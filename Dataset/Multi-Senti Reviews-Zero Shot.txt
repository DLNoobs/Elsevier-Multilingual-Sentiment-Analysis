The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.	1
You won't regret it!	1
I love this phone!.	1
A Disappointment.	0
Its not user friendly.	0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0
This PDA rocks.	1
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	1
Pretty piece of junk.	0
Plug was the wrong size.	0
Works as described.	1
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0
Bad Purchase.	0
WELL IM SATISFIED.	1
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.	1
This battery is an excellent bargain!	1
Defective crap.	0
I would have given no star if I was able.	0
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.	1
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.	0
I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0
great...no problems at all!.	1
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	1
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	0
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.	1
very good product, well made.	1
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	1
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)	0
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!	1
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.	1
Works great!.	1
REALLY UGLY.	0
horrible, had to switch 3 times.	0
The noise shield is incrediable.	1
No real improvement.	0
Razr Battery - Good buy.	1
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
They refuse to refund or replace.	0
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
Great case and price!	1
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0
I am glad I purchased it.	1
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	0
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0
Don't buy this product.	0
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	0
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1
Thank you for such great service.	1
Its a total package.	1
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.	1
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
It's AGGRAVATING!	0
Great product for the price!.	1
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!	1
None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0
Please dont waste your money.	0
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	0
Disapointing Results.	0
Cumbersome design.	0
Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!	1
Great Product.	1
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	0
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0
This fixes all the problems.	1
Worst ever.	0
I am very happy	1
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	1
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	0
The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0
That company is a joke.	0
It does everything the description said it would.	1
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	0
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	0
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.	0
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
Better than expected.	1
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
Battery is holding up well.	1
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
Sprint - terrible customer service.	0
Linked to my phone without effort.	1
THey are so cool!	1
Easy to use.	1
Better Than New.	1
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	0
Piece of trash.	0
A pretty good product.	1
This is a great phone!.	1
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	1
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0
Those phones are working just fine now.	1
I am more than happy with this product.	1
Poor Construction.	0
This is infuriating.	0
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1
Sprint charges for this service.	0
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	1
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0
Poor product.	0
However I needed some better instructions.	0
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
Very Dissapointing Performance.	0
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
Don't bother - go to the store.	0
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	1
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	1
You get what you pay for I guess.	0
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1
These are fabulous!	1
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	0
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0
Very wind-resistant.	1
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	0
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1
Great phone.	1
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0
I'm pleased.	1
Battery is terrible.	0
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	1
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	0
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	0
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
Talk about USELESS customer service.	0
It felt too light and "tinny.".	0
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	1
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	1
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
Does everything it should and more.	1
I could not recommend these more.	0
Nice Sound.	1
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1
Setup went very smoothly.	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.	0
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	0
Truly awful.	0
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	1
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
And none of the tones is acceptable.	0
camera color balance is AWFUL.	0
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	1
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.	0
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	1
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
Works well.	1
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.	0
Clear crisp sound.	1
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	0
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1
It doesn't make you look cool.	0
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0
You can't beat the price on these.	1
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1
lightweight and works well.	1
So just beware.	0
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	0
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	0
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	0
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	0
Poor quality.	0
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.	1
Not worth it.	0
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	0
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	0
It was a great phone.	1
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	1
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	0
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?	1
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.	0
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	1
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros	0
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1
Krussel Always good.	1
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	1
The design is very good.4.	1
I great reception all the time.	1
I would highly recommend this product.	1
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.	0
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	0
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is	1
stay away from this store, be careful.	0
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.	1
Does not fit.	0
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1
disappointing.	0
Blue Ant is easy to use.	1
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	1
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.	0
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	1
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.	0
The sound quality is excellent as well.	1
Its the best headset I have used.	1
Would not reccommend.	0
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.	0
wont work right or atleast for me.	0
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	0
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.	0
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good	0
Great product.	1
Crisp and Clear.	1
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.	0
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.	0

The reception has been generally good.	1
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	1
Great bluetooth!.	1
I highly recommend this case.	1
WORTHWHILE.	1
This is a great deal.	1
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0
I am sorry I made this purchase.	0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	0
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	0
It was horrible!.	0
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	0
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	0
They work about 2 weeks then break.	0
It is simple to use and I like it.	1
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	0
NOT WHAT I WANTED.	0
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.	1
Great Phone.	1
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0
Perfect for the PS3.	1
Five star Plus, plus.	1
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.	1
$50 Down the drain.	0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0
Good , works fine.	1
For the price this was a great deal.	1
Great price, too!	1
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.	0
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1
Does Not Work.	0
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	0
The reception through this headset is excellent.	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1

Product is exactly as described.	1
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.	1
Doesn't do the job.	0

Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	1
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.	1
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1
Awkward to use and unreliable.	0

My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	0
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	0
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.	0
Horrible, horrible protector.	0
I don't like this Nokia either.	0
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.	0
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!	0
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.	0
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.	0
It's not what it says it is.	0

Used and dirty.	0
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	0

I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.	1
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	0
Comfortable in my hand.	1
Just does not work.	0
Poor Reliability.	0
(It works!)	1
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.	0
Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
Last time buying from you.	0
It was a waste of my money.	0
So far it has worked like a charm.	1
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	1
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.	1
Would recommend this item.	1
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	1
Nice case, feels good in your hands.	1
The item received was Counterfeit.	0
Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.	1
Works fine.	1
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	1
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	1
My sister has one also and she loves it.	1
Good Quality.	1
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	0
Excellent dual-purpose headset.	1
Excellent!.	1
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	0
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.	1
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.	0
Having trouble with volume.	0
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	1
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.	0
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	1
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.	0
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	0
Best headset ever!!!.	1
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	1
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.	0
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1

Bad Reception.	0
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!	0
It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
Great phone.	1
Don't buy this product - It fails!.	0
Everything about this product is wrong.First	0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	1
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	0
Terrible phone holder.	0
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	0
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	0
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
How stupid is that?	0
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	1
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	1
Good show, Samsung.	1
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	1
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	0
Couldn't figure it out	0
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.	0
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	0
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	1

I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	1
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	0

Very satisifed with that.	1

This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	1
Buttons are too small.	0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
Love it.. Great armband.	1
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	0
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	1
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	1

It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1

The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	0
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0
Wasted two hours.  	0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1
A bit predictable.  	0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	1
And those baby owls were adorable.  	1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	1
It Was So Cool.  	1
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  	1
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  	1
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste your money on this game.  	1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
Today the graphics are crap.  	0
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Totally believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  	0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  	1
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	1
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
Give this one a look.  	1
I gave it a 10  	1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1
It is a true classic.  	1
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
The problem was the script.  	0
It was horrendous.  	0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	1
I don't think you will be disappointed.  	1
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0
Too politically correct.  	0
Very disappointing.  	0
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  	0
The directing seems too pretentious.  	0
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  	0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	1
I really liked that.  	1
A great film by a great director.  	1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1
The music in the film is really nice too.  	1
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
Brilliant!  	1
10/10  	1
I liked this movie way too much.  	1
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0
All in all, a great disappointment.  	0
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  	0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	0
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  	0
A truly, truly bad film.  	0
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  	0
I paid too much.  	0
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  	1
It was so BORING!  	0
No plot whatsoever!  	0
Again, no plot at all.  	0
Horrible!  	0
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  	0
I hate movies like that.  	0
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	0
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  	0
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	0
Awful.  	0
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	0
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	0
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0
I mean this in a terrible way.  	0
This film has no redeeming features.  	0
Everything is appalling.  	0
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	0
The story is beyond stupid.  	0
The script iswas there a script?  	0
The kids are annoying.  	0
The lead man is charisma-free.  	0
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  	0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
Highly unrecommended.  	0
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  	0
Yes, it's that bad.  	0
Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  	0
There were too many close ups.  	0
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0
"You'll love it!  	1
This movie is BAD.  	0
So bad.  	0
The film is way too long.  	0
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
His performance is simply genius.  	1
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  	1
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1
It was so funny.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
The acting was bad.  	0
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	0
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	0
This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
It even has its sweet moments.  	1
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	1
And I really did find them funny.  	1
This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1
" I love it.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
This movie is terrible.  	0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
The kids are very cool too.  	1
" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  	0
It's just lame.  	0
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  	0
Everything about this movie is stupid.  	0
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0
It is shameful.  	0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  	1
The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  	1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  	1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	1
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  	1
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	1
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  	0
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  	0
It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  	0
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	0
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  	0
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  	0
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	0
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  	0
Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	1
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	0
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  	0
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	0
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	0
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  	1
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	1
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  	1
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	1
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	1
This is high adventure at its best.  	1
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	0
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	0
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	0
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	1
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	1
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	1
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  	1
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  	1
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  	1
I rather enjoyed it.  	1
I liked it.  	1
I couldn't take them seriously.  	0
It really created a unique feeling though.  	1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
Her role was played well.  	1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1
The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	1
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0
Even worse than Ticker!  	0
& That movie was bad.  	0
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  	0
It just blew.  	0
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  	1
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  	0
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	0
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  	0
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	0
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	0
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	0
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	1
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	1
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  	0
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	1
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  	1
Wow, what a bad film.  	0
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	0
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
Not even good for camp value!  	0
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  	0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  	0
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  	0
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  	0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  	0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	0
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	0
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  	0
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	1
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0
Even the squibs look awful.  	0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  	0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
Of course, the acting is blah.  	0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	1
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	1
But this movie really got to me.  	1
See it.  	1
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	1
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  	1
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  	1
The rest of the cast also play well.  	1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	0
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  	0
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0
The cast is good.  	1
For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	0
Everything about it is just bad.  	0
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0
The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	0
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  	0
It is zillion times away from reality.  	0
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  	0
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  	0
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	0
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	0
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	0
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  	0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	0
the cast was great.  	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  	1
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	0
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  	0
there is no real plot.  	0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	1
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  	1
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	0
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  	0
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  	1
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	0
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	0
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	0
I thought it was bad.  	0
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	0
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	0
The script is a big flawed mess.  	0
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	0
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  	0
The movie is terribly boring in places.  	0
The lighting is awful.  	0
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
The visual effects were AWFUL.  	0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  	0
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  	0
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	1
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	0
Not recommended.  	0
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	0
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	0
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
Filmiing was less expansive.  	0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0
Not recommended.  	0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  	0
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	0
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  	0
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	0
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  	1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	0
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  	0
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
The story line is just awful!  	0
It's just painful!  	0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	0
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  	0
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  	1
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	1
Go watch it!  	1
Omit watching this.  	0
VERY funny!  	1
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  	0
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	1
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1
Don't miss it.  	1
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
Avoid at all costs.  	0
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	1
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  	0
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
Overall, a delight!  	1
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0
The least said about the acting the better.  	0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  	1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  	1
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
Excellent performance.  	1
There still are good actors around!  	1
Also great directing and photography.  	1
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	1
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	0
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  	0
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
It is not good.  	0
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  	0
Then the film just dropped the ball.  	0
This is a stunning movie.  	1
Raw and sublimely moving.  	1
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
All of the main players are mesmerising.  	1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	1
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	1
He's a national treasure.  	1
GO AND SEE IT!  	1
This is an excellent film.  	1
The aerial scenes were well-done.  	1
It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  	1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1
A good film by a great director!  	1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0
This is just a great movie.  	1
10 out of 10 stars.  	1
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  	1
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	1
I advise you to look out for it.  	1
You wont regret it!  	1
Highly recommended A+  	1
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  	0
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	0
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  	0
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  	0
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  	0
How awful she is!  	0
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  	0
The results, well, are a shame.  	0
DELETE this film from your mind!  	0
One of the worst shows of all time.  	0
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  	0
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	0
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  	0
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  	0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  	0
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  	0
You can find better movies at youtube.  	0
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  	0
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  	0
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  	0
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  	0
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	0
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  	0
Avoid, avoid, avoid!  	0
It will drive you barking mad!  	0
The transfers are very good.  	1
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	1
) some great music, and terrific scenery.  	1
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	1
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  	1
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1
Nothing new there.  	0
That was done in the second movie.  	0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  	0
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  	1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0
But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
Meredith M was better than all right.  	1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  	1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  	1
A standout scene.  	1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1
This movie is also revealing.  	1
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	1
And it was boring.  	0
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	1
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
You won't forget this movie!  	1
Why was this film made?  	0
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  	0
The result is a film that just don't look right.  	0
None of them are engaging or exciting.  	0
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  	0
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	0
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  	1
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  	1
This movie is so awesome!  	1
I loved it, it was really scary.  	1
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1
If you want a real scare rent this one!  	1
10/10  	1
This is an extraordinary film.  	1
As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1
She carries the movie well.  	1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	1
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
Avoid at ALL costs!  	0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
The worst one of the series.  	0
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  	1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	1
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	1
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	1
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  	1
See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	1
See both films if you can.  	1
It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.  	1
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
It's very slow.  	0
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0
) Don't waste your time.  	0
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  	0
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	0
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1
" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  	1
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  	0
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	0
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0
Hated it.  	0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	0
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0
This is not movie-making.  	0
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1
Excellent short film.  	1
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	0
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0
The story line is totally predictable.  	0
Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  	0
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0
Really awful.  	0
Not easy to watch.  	0
Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
I rate this movie 9/10.  	1
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	1
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	1
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	1
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
Go rent it.  	1
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
Brilliance indeed.  	1
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
Think of the film being like a dream.  	1
Simply beautiful.  	1
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	1
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	0
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	0
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  	1
I enjoyed it.  	1
I have recommended it to friends.  	1
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	1
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	1
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	1
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  	1
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	0
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	0
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1
I keep watching it over and over.  	1
It's a sad movie, but very good.  	1
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
;) Recommend with confidence!  	1
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	1
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1
Lange had become a great actress.  	1
It looked like a wonderful story.  	1
I never walked out of a movie faster.  	0
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
In a word, it is embarrassing.  	0
Exceptionally bad!  	0
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	0
Wow... Loved this place.	1
Crust is not good.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0

The fries were great too.	1
A great touch.	1
Service was very prompt.	1
Would not go back.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
Highly recommended.	1
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0

The Burrittos Blah!	0
The food, amazing.	1
Service is also cute.	1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1
So they performed.	1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
This was like the final blow!	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
Ample portions and good prices.	1
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
Service sucks.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
Their chow mein is so good!	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
The portion was huge!	1
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
We'd definitely go back here again.	1
We are so glad we found this place.	1
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
A great way to finish a great.	1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
The service was meh.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
This place has it!	1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
We'll never go again.	0
Will be back again!	1
Food arrived quickly!	1
It was not good.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
Will go back next trip out.	1
Sooooo good!!	1
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
Good prices.	1
Check it out.	1
It was pretty gross!	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
I wouldn't return.	0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
Penne vodka excellent!	1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
The management is rude.	0
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
Don't do it!!!!	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
this place is good.	1
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
I was seated immediately.	1
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
Avoid at all cost!	0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
DELICIOUS!!	1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
I've never been treated so bad.	0
Bacon is hella salty.	1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
The waitresses are very friendly.	1
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
It was probably dirt.	0
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Interesting decor.	1
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Very friendly staff.	1
It is worth the drive.	1
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
The warm beer didn't help.	0
Great brunch spot.	1
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
Very good lunch spot.	1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
Won't go back.	0
Extremely Tasty!	1
Waitress was good though!	1
Soggy and not good.	0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
The service was a bit lacking.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
Very very fun chef.	1
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
Owner's are really great people.!	1
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
Fantastic service here.	1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
They know how to make them here.	1
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
I hope this place sticks around.	1
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1
The service was not up to par, either.	0
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
You can't beat that.	1
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
I think not again	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
Service stinks here!	0
I waited and waited.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
Great Pizza and Salads!	1
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
This place is amazing!	1
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
Food was really boring.	0
Good Service-check!	1
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
I did not expect this to be so good!	1
Fantastic food!	1
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
The food was very good.	1
Never going back.	0
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
All the bread is made in-house!	1
The only downside is the service.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
You won't be disappointed.	1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1
Everything was gross.	0

There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
Pretty good beer selection too.	1
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1

Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1

He deserves 5 stars.	1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1

I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1

But now I was completely grossed out.	0
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
What a mistake that was!	0
No complaints!	1

It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0

I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
I'd love to go back.	1
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
Nothing special.	0
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1

Will not be back.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1

The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Love the margaritas, too!	1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1
Very good, though!	1
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
Great pork sandwich.	1
Don't waste your time here.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
I LOVED it!	1
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
How awesome is that.	1
I will be back many times soon.	1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0

Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1
And then tragedy struck.	0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1
Waitress was sweet and funny.	1

If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
first time there and might just be the last.	0
Those burgers were amazing.	1
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1

The bartender was also nice.	1
Everything was good and tasty!	1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1

Food was delicious!	1
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I consider this theft.	0

Not good for the money.	0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0

I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1

Pretty awesome place.	1
Ambience is perfect.	1
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0

It was just not a fun experience.	1
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1

Both great!	1

Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Great food and awesome service!	1

A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1

Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1

When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
Will not be back!	0
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0

I'm so happy to be here!!!"	1
Tasted like dirt.	0
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
The block was amazing.	1
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
We will not be coming back.	0
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0

अब तक यह एक आकर्षण की तरह काम किया है।	1
मेरे पास केवल कुछ हफ्तों के लिए है, लेकिन अभी तक, इतना अच्छा है।	1
लेकिन, किसी भी मामले में, सबसे अच्छी बात यह है कि आप इन तस्वीरों को आईआर का उपयोग करके अपने लैपटॉप पर डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं, या यहां तक कि अपने लैपटॉप से फोन पर तस्वीरें भी भेज सकते हैं।	1
इस मद की सिफारिश करेंगे।	1

लगभग उतनी अच्छी नहीं लग रही है जितनी AMAZON की तस्वीर दिखती है।	0
लेकिन इन कुछ खामियों के बावजूद, यह मामला असाधारण गुणवत्ता का है और आधिकारिक OEM उत्पाद के स्वामित्व की अतिरिक्त लागत के लायक है।	1
कितना बेवकूफ है?	0
जब मैं कार में ड्राइव कर रहा हूं तो मैं सुन सकता हूं, और आमतौर पर इसे जोर से लगाने की जरूरत नहीं है।	1
विक्रेता जल्दी से भेज दिया और प्रतियोगियों की तुलना में बहुत सस्ता है।	1

लव इट .. ग्रेट आर्मबैंड।	1
मैं वास्तव में मोटोरोला के इस उत्पाद को पसंद करता हूं क्योंकि यह कान के टुकड़े और माइक पर स्पष्ट है।	1
हालाँकि, कीपैड इतने तीखे होते हैं कि मैं कभी-कभी गलत बटन तक पहुँच जाता हूँ।	0
मैंने इसके लिए Sony ericson z500a का आदान-प्रदान किया और मैं उस निर्णय से बहुत खुश हूं।	1

यह बहुत आसान है।	1
मैं कुछ स्थानों पर कॉल नहीं कर सकता।	0
हालाँकि, मेरी लड़की को शिकायत थी कि कुछ समय में फोन नहीं उठता है जैसे कि सामान्य फोन करता है।	0

यह सबसे अच्छा चार्जर है जिसे मैंने अभी तक बाजार पर देखा है।	1
सबसे पहले फोन !!!	1
:-) ओह, चार्जर ठीक काम करने लगता है।	1
यह इतनी सुरक्षित रूप से फिट बैठता है कि कान के हुक का भी उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है और ध्वनि आपके कान नहर के माध्यम से बेहतर निर्देशित होती है।	1
पर्याप्त मात्रा में नहीं।	0
इको प्रॉब्लम .... बहुत असंतोषजनक	0

केवल एक चीज जो मुझे निराश करती है, वह है इंफ्रा रेड पोर्ट (इरडा)।	0
आप इकाई के साथ कॉल का जवाब नहीं दे सकते, कभी भी एक बार काम नहीं किया!	0
एक बहुत, बहुत, बहुत धीमी गति से चलती है, एक व्यथित, बहती नौजवान के बारे में लक्ष्यहीन फिल्म।	0
निश्चित नहीं कि कौन अधिक खो गया था - सपाट पात्र या दर्शक, जिनमें से लगभग आधे लोग बाहर चले गए।	0
काले और सफेद और चालाक कैमरा कोणों के साथ कलात्मकता का प्रयास करते हुए, फिल्म निराश - और भी हास्यास्पद हो गई - क्योंकि अभिनय खराब था और कथानक और रेखाएं लगभग न के बराबर थीं।	0
बहुत कम संगीत या कुछ भी बोलने के लिए।	0
फिल्म में सबसे अच्छा दृश्य था जब गेरार्डो एक गीत खोजने की कोशिश कर रहा था जो उसके सिर के माध्यम से चलता रहता है।	1
फिल्म के बाकी हिस्सों में कला, आकर्षण, अर्थ का अभाव है ... अगर यह खालीपन के बारे में है, तो यह काम करता है क्योंकि मुझे लगता है कि यह खाली है।	0
दो घंटे बर्बाद।	0
आज फिल्म देखी और सोचा कि यह एक अच्छा प्रयास है, बच्चों के लिए अच्छा संदेश है।	1
थोडा प्रेडिक्टेबल।	0
विज्ञान शिक्षक के रूप में जिमी बफे की कास्टिंग पसंद आई।	1
और वे बच्चे उल्लू के आराध्य थे।	1
फिल्म ने बहुत सारे फ्लोरिडा को बेहतरीन तरीके से दिखाया, यह बहुत आकर्षक लग रहा था।	1
गाने सर्वश्रेष्ठ थे और मपेट्स इतने प्रफुल्लित थे।	1
इट वाज़ सो कूल।	1
यह एक बहुत ही &quot;राइट ऑन केस&quot; फिल्म है जो आपके चेहरे में लगभग सब कुछ ठीक करती है।	1
इसमें मुख्य व्यक्ति से कुछ औसत अभिनय था, और यह कम बजट था जैसा कि आप स्पष्ट रूप से देख सकते हैं।	0
यह समीक्षा बहुत लंबी है, क्योंकि मैं ए टेल ऑफ टू सिस्टर्स को अब तक की सबसे बड़ी फिल्म मानता हूं।	1
मैं इस मणि को किसी भी फिल्म के खिलाफ स्क्रीनप्ले, सिनेमैटोग्राफी, एक्टिंग, पोस्ट-प्रोडक्शन, एडिटिंग, निर्देशन या फिल्म-निर्माण के किसी अन्य पहलू के संदर्भ में रखूंगा।	1
यह उन सभी में व्यावहारिक रूप से परिपूर्ण है - अशुद्ध &quot;मास्टरपीस&quot; के समुद्र में एक सच्ची कृति।	1
“इस फिल्म की संरचना आसानी से सिनेमा के इतिहास में सबसे कसकर बनाई गई है।	1
मैं किसी अन्य फिल्म के बारे में नहीं सोच सकता हूं जहां हर दूसरे मिनट में कुछ महत्वपूर्ण हो।	1
दूसरे शब्दों में, इस फिल्म का कंटेंट स्तर एक दर्जन अन्य फिल्मों को आसानी से भरने के लिए पर्याप्त है।	1
उनके सही दिमाग में कोई भी किसी फिल्म से ज्यादा कुछ कैसे मांग सकता है?	1
यह कल्पनाशील के रूप में सिनेमा का उच्चतम, सबसे शानदार रूप है।	1
हां, इस फिल्म को पहेली को सुलझाने के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण मात्रा की आवश्यकता होती है, लेकिन एक सुंदर चित्र बनाने के लिए टुकड़े एक साथ फिट होते हैं।	1
यह लघु फिल्म निश्चित रूप से कोई छिद्र नहीं खींचती है।	0
ग्राफिक्स गेम के सबसे अच्छे हिस्से से दूर है।	0
यह श्रृंखला में नंबर एक सर्वश्रेष्ठ टीएच गेम है।	1
यह मजबूत प्यार का हकदार है।	1
यह एक पागल खेल है।	1
बड़े पैमाने पर स्तर हैं, बड़े पैमाने पर अनलॉक करने योग्य वर्ण ... यह सिर्फ एक विशाल खेल है।	1
इस खेल पर अपना पैसा बर्बाद करो।	1
यह एक ऐसा पैसा है जो ठीक से बर्बाद हो जाता है।	1
दरअसल, उस समय ग्राफिक्स अच्छे थे।	1
आज ग्राफिक्स बकवास है।	0
जैसा कि वे कनाडा में कहते हैं, यह मजेदार खेल है, ऐ।	1
यह खेल चट्टानों।	1
इसे खरीदें, इसे खेलें, इसका आनंद लें, इसे प्यार करें।	1
यह शुद्ध ब्रिलियन है।	1
यह एक गर्भाधान था।	0
इसका बहुत बड़ा विचार लंगड़ा था - एक औसत दर्जे की पीजी -13 फिल्म से एक मामूली चरित्र को ले लो, और पीजी-रेटेड पारिवारिक फिल्म के लिए अपने स्वर को बदलते हुए एक पूर्ण गैर-अगली कड़ी बनाएं।	0
मुझे कम से कम दिलचस्पी नहीं थी।	0
न केवल इस बात की पुष्टि की कि फिल्म अधूरी और सामान्य होगी, बल्कि यह ENTIRE फिल्म को भी देने में सफल रही; और मैं अतिशयोक्ति नहीं कर रहा हूं - हर पल, हर प्लॉट बिंदु, हर मजाक को ट्रेलर में बताया गया है।	0
लेकिन यह सिर्फ मजाक नहीं है।	0
लेकिन यहां तक कि प्रतिभाशाली कैरेल इसे बचा नहीं सकते हैं।	0
मॉर्गन फ्रीमैन, जोनाह हिल, और एड हेल्स जैसे लोगों के साथ उनके सह-कलाकार बेहतर प्रदर्शन नहीं करते हैं।	0
कहानी अपने आप में केवल पूर्वानुमान और आलसी है।	0
एकमात्र वास्तविक प्रभाव कार्य सभी जानवरों की उपस्थिति है, और उन दृश्यों में एकीकरण कुछ सबसे खराब और सबसे स्पष्ट नीले / हरे रंग की स्क्रीन का काम है जो मैंने कभी देखा है।	0
लेकिन जो कुछ भी यह था कि उनकी लागत इतनी थी, यह गुणवत्ता में अनुवाद नहीं हुआ, यह सुनिश्चित है।	0
स्पष्ट रूप से अल्प बजट के बावजूद फिल्म सफल हुई या शायद।	1
मुझे खुशी है कि फिल्म सबसे स्पष्ट विकल्प के लिए नहीं गई, क्योंकि निश्चित रूप से कम फिल्म होगी।	1
अब तक के सबसे प्यारे गीतों में से एक होने के अलावा, फ्रांसीसी कैनकन ने स्क्रीन पर अनुग्रह करने के लिए सबसे अग्रणी महिलाओं में से एक का दावा किया है।	1
उस लड़की के साथ प्यार में सिर-से-ऊँची एड़ी के जूते नहीं गिरना मुश्किल है।	1
नकारात्मक पर, यह स्क्रीन के सामने बर्बाद होने वाले जीवन के 2 घंटे के लिए खेद पैदा करने के लिए पर्याप्त नहीं है।	0
लंबी, कड़क और व्यर्थ।	0
लेकिन मैं उनके भविष्य के प्रयासों की प्रतीक्षा करने की सलाह देता हूं, इसे जाने दो।	0
बेहतरीन कास्ट, स्टोरी लाइन, प्रदर्शन।	1
पूरी तरह से विश्वसनीय।	1
ऐनी Heche पूरी तरह से आश्वस्त था।	1
सैम शेपर्ड ने एक गंग हो मरीन की भूमिका निभाई थी।	1
मैं टीवी स्क्रीन पर जा बैठा।	1
सब सब में मैं यह एक 10 में से एक शानदार 9 दे।	1
मुझे लगता है कि टॉम हैंक्स एक अच्छे अभिनेता हैं।	1
मुझे अपने बच्चों को यह पुस्तक पढ़ने में मज़ा आया जब वे छोटे थे।	1
मैं फिल्म में बहुत निराश था।	0
एक चरित्र पूरी तरह से एक आवाज से परेशान है जो मुझे एक चॉकबोर्ड पर नाखूनों की भावना देता है।	0
पूरी तरह से अनावश्यक ट्रेन / रोलर कोस्टर दृश्य है।	0
इन दृश्यों या पात्रों के लिए कोई गर्मजोशी या आकर्षण नहीं था।	0
यह फिल्म पूरी तरह से मेरी नसों पर कसा हुआ है।	0
प्रदर्शन में सुधार नहीं किया गया है, क्योंकि अभिनेताओं के पास अब चिंता करने के लिए दोगुना है: न केवल यह कि वे लाइन को अच्छी तरह से वितरित कर रहे हैं, लेकिन क्या लाइन ही अच्छी है।	0
और, काफी ईमानदारी से, अक्सर यह बहुत अच्छा नहीं है।	0
अक्सर संवाद वास्तव में एक पंक्ति से दूसरी पंक्ति का अनुसरण नहीं करता है, या परिवेश को फिट नहीं करता है।	0
यह एक अप्रत्याशित, युवा ऊर्जा के साथ क्रैक करता है - लेकिन ईमानदारी से, मुझे यह मुश्किल से पालन करना और ध्यान केंद्रित करना मुश्किल लगा।	0
इसमें आमतौर पर कुछ महान चीजें हैं।	1
मैं नहीं कहूंगा कि वे आपके समय के 2 घंटे के लायक हैं, हालांकि।	0
सस्पेंस बिल्डर्स अच्छे थे, और बस जी से पीजी तक लाइन पार करते थे।	1
मैं विशेष रूप से माता-पिता के साथ गैर-क्लिच विकल्पों को पसंद करता था; अन्य फिल्मों में, मैं संवाद शब्दशः की भविष्यवाणी कर सकता था, लेकिन इस फिल्म में लेखन ने बेहतर चयन किया।	1
अगर आप ऐसी फिल्म चाहते हैं जो कि ग्रॉस न हो लेकिन आपको कुछ ठंडक प्रदान करे, तो यह एक बढ़िया विकल्प है।	1
अलेक्जेंडर नेवस्की एक बेहतरीन फिल्म है।	1
वह एक अद्भुत फिल्म कलाकार हैं, जो भी सबसे महत्वपूर्ण व्यक्ति थे।	1
मुझे खुशी है कि s का यह दिखावा टुकड़ा *** चकमा स्ट्रैटस बिग शॉट्स द्वारा नियोजित नहीं किया गया ... यह फिल्म निर्माताओं की मदद करने वाला है जो क्वेबेक के बहुत संयमित &quot;मूवी व्यवसाय&quot; में नहीं हैं।	0
यह अगर पहली फिल्म मैंने 10 साल में दी है।	1
अगर कभी कोई ऐसी फिल्म थी जिसे प्रमोट करने के लिए वर्ड ऑफ माउथ की जरूरत थी, तो वह यही है।	1
कुल मिलाकर, फिल्म दिलचस्प और सोची-समझी है।	1
इसके अलावा, यह अच्छी तरह से चित्रित किया गया था और इसके अपेक्षाकृत कम समय के लिए अनुकूल था।	1
इसे एक रूप दें।	1
मैंने इसे 10 दिया	1
द विंड एंड लायन अच्छी तरह से लिखा गया है और शानदार अभिनय किया गया है।	1
यह एक सच्चा क्लासिक है।	1
यह वास्तव में बी-सूची हॉरर / सस्पेंस फिल्मों के रूप में दूर तक बहुत सभ्य निकला।	1
निश्चित रूप से जाँच के लायक है।	1
समस्या स्क्रिप्ट थी।	0
यह भयावह था।	0
इसके बारे में विश्वसनीय कुछ भी नहीं था।	0
केवल एक ही सस्पेंस मुझे महसूस हो रहा था कि लड़कियों को कितना मंदबुद्धि समझा जाता है।	0
MANNA से हेवन एक भयानक फिल्म है जो एक ही समय में अनुमानित और अप्रत्याशित दोनों है।	1
दृश्य अक्सर मजाकिया होते हैं और कभी-कभी स्पर्श होते हैं जैसे कि चरित्र उनके जीवन का मूल्यांकन करते हैं और वे कहां जा रहे हैं।	1
दिग्गज अभिनेताओं की कास्ट सिर्फ एक नॉस्टेल्जिया यात्रा से अधिक है।	1
नन का उर्सुला बर्टन का चित्रण एक ही समय में नन या चर्च का मज़ाक उड़ाने के साथ-साथ स्पर्श और मज़ाक दोनों है।	1
यदि आप एक शानदार कलाकारों के साथ एक फिल्म की तलाश कर रहे हैं, तो कुछ अच्छे संगीत (एक शर्ली जोन्स (&quot;द वे यू लुक टुनाइट&quot; का गायन भी शामिल है), और एक उत्थान समाप्त होता है, इसे एक कोशिश दें।	1
मुझे नहीं लगता कि आप निराश होंगे।	1
स्पष्ट रूप से, कॉटन क्लब और अनफाथफुल के बाद, इस फिल्म में लेन और गेर को देखना शर्मनाक था, क्योंकि यह बीएडी है।	0
अभिनय खराब था, संवाद बेहद उथले और जिद्दी थे।	0
यह बहुत अनुमानित था, यहां तक कि एक चिक फ्लिक के लिए भी।	0
राजनीतिक रूप से बहुत सही।	0
बहुत निराशाजनक।	0
वास्तव में देखने लायक एकमात्र चीज़ दृश्य और घर थी, क्योंकि यह सुंदर है।	1
मैं लेन से प्यार करता हूं, लेकिन मैंने उसे इस घटिया फिल्म में कभी नहीं देखा।	0
एक घंटा और एक आधा काश मैं वापस ला सकता था।	0
लेकिन लेखन के मामले में यह बहुत ताज़ा और बोल्ड है।	1
अभिनय बहुत अच्छी तरह से लिखने में मदद करता है (हो सकता है कि बेवकूफ-प्रेमी बहन बेहतर खेला जा सकता था), और यह देखने के लिए एक वास्तविक खुशी है।	1
निर्देशन और सिनेमैटोग्राफी काफी अच्छी नहीं हैं।	0
फिल्म इतनी उबाऊ थी, कि मैंने कभी-कभी देखने के बजाय कागज पर खुद को व्यस्त पाया और इससे पहले कभी कोलम्बो फिल्म के दौरान ऐसा नहीं हुआ था!	0
), और कभी-कभी यह इतना शर्मनाक होता था कि मुझे दूर देखना पड़ता था।	0
निर्देशन भी दिखावा लगता है।	0
&quot;ओह-सो-मेच्योर&quot; पड़ोसी-लड़की के साथ दृश्य एक मिथ्या है।	0
और आम तौर पर लाइनें और प्लॉट औसत एपिसोड से कमजोर होते हैं।	0
तब दृश्य जहां उन्होंने बहस की कि क्या ट्रम्पेटर को बर्खास्त करना या नहीं करना (जो हत्या के लिए झूठा आरोप लगाया गया था) शुद्ध डरावनी है, वास्तव में बेवकूफ है।	0
कुछ तालियाँ हालांकि &quot;प्रस्तावना&quot; को दी जानी चाहिए।	1
मुझे वह बहुत पसंद आया।	1
एक महान निर्देशक द्वारा एक बेहतरीन फिल्म।	1
फिल्म ने आपको अपनी सीट के किनारे पर खड़ा कर दिया था और रात के अंत में आपको अपनी कार में जाने से कुछ हद तक डर लगता था।	1
फिल्म का संगीत वाकई बहुत अच्छा है।	1
मैं किसी को भी इसे देखने और जाने की सलाह दूंगा।	1
प्रतिभाशाली!	1
10/10	1
मुझे यह फिल्म तरीका बहुत पसंद आया।	1
मेरी एकमात्र समस्या मुझे लगा कि खलनायक का किरदार निभाने वाला अभिनेता कम किराए का माइकल आयरनसाइड था।	0
इसने मेरी दुनिया को हिलाकर रख दिया और निश्चित रूप से किसी भी सामाजिक या शारीरिक दुकानों के लिए किसी को भी देखना चाहिए।	1
हालांकि, यह इस तथ्य के लिए नहीं बना कि कुल मिलाकर, यह एक जबरदस्त उबाऊ फिल्म थी।	0
इस फिल्म में बेन एफ्लेक और सैंड्रा बुलॉक के बीच कोई केमिस्ट्री नहीं थी, और मैं समझ नहीं पा रहा था कि वह इस चिक के लिए अपनी पत्नी को छोड़ने पर भी विचार क्यों करेगा, जिसे उसने माना था।	0
फिल्म में कई ऐसे क्षण थे जिन्हें बस होने की जरूरत नहीं थी और वे धीरे-धीरे आगे बढ़ रहे थे।	0
यह &quot;माई बेस्ट फ्रेंड्स वेडिंग&quot; का घटिया रीमेक था।	0
सब सब में, एक बड़ी निराशा।	0
मुझे विश्वास नहीं हो रहा है कि अभिनेता इस &quot;फिल्म&quot; को करने के लिए सहमत हुए हैं।	0
मैं IQ खोने के डर से बहुत लंबे समय तक इसे देखने के लिए खड़ा नहीं हो सका	0
मुझे लगता है कि इस ड्रिबल को प्रसारित करने वाले नेटवर्क पर कोई भी इसे डालने से पहले नहीं देखता।	0
IMDB रेटिंग केवल भयावह के लिए कम 1 के रूप में जाती है, इन जैसे मामलों के लिए वहां कुछ नकारात्मक संख्या प्राप्त करने का समय है।	0
मैंने कल रात &quot;मिररमास्क&quot; देखा और यह एक असंतोषजनक अनुभव था।	0
दुर्भाग्य से, दिशा की अनुभवहीनता का मतलब यह था कि दृश्य के बाद का दृश्य नाटकीय तनाव या संघर्ष के रास्ते में बहुत कम गुजरता था।	0
ये फिल्म के केंद्रीय विषय हैं और इन्हें अयोग्य रूप से, स्टीरियोटाइप रूप से और कल्पना की गहराई के साथ नियंत्रित किया जाता है।	0
दुनिया के सभी सुंदर चित्र काम के एक टुकड़े के लिए नहीं बना सकते हैं जो कोर में त्रुटिपूर्ण है।	0
यह बहुत ही उच्च विद्यालय के छात्रों का एक समूह है और जीवन के बारे में रोने के बाद एक घंटे का समय बर्बाद करता है।	0
आप उनके साथ संबंध नहीं रख सकते, नरक आप उन्हें मुश्किल से समझ सकते हैं।	0
यह निश्चित रूप से एक पंथ क्लासिक अच्छी तरह से देखने और दूसरों के साथ साझा करने के लायक है।	1
यह फिल्म एक शुद्ध आपदा है, कहानी बेवकूफ है और संपादन मैंने सबसे खराब देखा है, यह आपको अविश्वसनीय रूप से भ्रमित करता है।	0
मछली को बुरी तरह से बनाया गया है और इसके कुछ पानी के नीचे के शॉट्स को फिल्म में एक हजार बार दोहराया गया है।	0
एक सही मायने में, एक बुरी फिल्म।	0
अभिनय भयानक है, और लेखन बदतर है।	0
इस फिल्म को एकमात्र संभव तरीके से भुनाया जा सकता है, जैसा कि MST3K चारा होगा।	0
मैंने बहुत अधिक भुगतान किया।	0
इसके अलावा, एंथनी क्विन को क्रेजी हॉर्स खेलते देखना एक वास्तविक उपचार है।	1
यह बहुत उबाऊ था!	0
कोई साजिश नहीं!	0
फिर, कोई साजिश नहीं।	0
भयानक!	0
मेरे जीवन का सबसे खराब घंटा और आधा! हे मेरे भगवान!	0
मुझे कुछ राहत पाने के लिए कुछ मिनट के लिए थिएटर से बाहर चलना पड़ा!	0
मुझे उस तरह की फिल्मों से नफरत है।	0
हाँ, फिल्म ने बहुत चूसा।	0
वहाँ कोई भूखंड या कहानी नहीं है !!	0
यदि आप इस फिल्म को देखने जाते हैं, तो एक तकिया या एक प्रेमिका / प्रेमी को अपने साथ रखने के लिए बाहर ले आओ।	0
बेकार।	0
मुझे नहीं लगता कि मैं कभी किसी फिल्म में गया हूं और इसे उतना ही नापसंद किया है।	0
यह एक अच्छी बात थी कि टिकटों की कीमत केवल पाँच डॉलर थी क्योंकि मैं पागल हो जाता अगर मैं इस बकवास को देखने के लिए $ 7.50 चुकाता।	0
NOBODY इन वर्णों की पहचान करता है क्योंकि वे सभी कार्डबोर्ड कटआउट और स्टीरियोटाइप (या अनुमानित रूप से रिवर्स-स्टीरियोटाइप) हैं।	0
यह एक बुरी फिल्म है, जिसमें खराब लेखन है, और अच्छे कलाकार हैं .... एक बदसूरत कार्टून जो पॉल हैगिस ने ऐसे लोगों के लिए तैयार किया है जो कहानी सुनाने में कुछ भी नहीं कर सकते हैं लेकिन कहानी में बोल्ड स्ट्रोक्स .... एक तस्वीर जो क्रेयॉन के साथ चित्रित है।	0
क्रैश एक निराशाजनक छोटी सी चीज़ है, जो भावना को भड़काता है, लेकिन आपको कुछ भी नहीं सिखाता है यदि आप पहले से ही नस्लवाद जानते हैं और पूर्वाग्रह बुरी चीजें हैं।	0
फिर भी, मुझे यह फिल्म महिलाओं के सशक्तिकरण के लिए पसंद है; वहाँ इस तरह से पर्याप्त फिल्में नहीं हैं।	1
आपका मस्तिष्क आत्म-संरक्षण के एक मौलिक आवेग के भाग के रूप में बंद करने का प्रयास करेगा।	0
इस &#39;फिल्म&#39; को देखने के अनुभव से मैं बिखर गया और मुझे पूरी तरह से ठीक होने में दो घंटे लग गए।	0
यह फिल्म अब हॉरर फिल्मों की नारकीय त्रिमूर्ति के हिस्से के रूप में बूगेमैन और ज़ोंबीज़ का बदला लेने में शामिल हो गई।	0
मैं निश्चित रूप से इस अंतर का मतलब अच्छे तरीके से नहीं करता हूं।	0
मेरा यह मतलब भयानक तरीके से है।	0
इस फिल्म में कोई नया प्रदर्शन नहीं है।	0
सब कुछ भयावह है।	0
आर्टलेस कैमरा-वर्क अंतहीन रूप से हमें सबसे बदसूरत सेटिंग के साथ प्रस्तुत करता है, यानी	0
कहानी बेवकूफी से परे है।	0
स्क्रिप्ट है ... क्या कोई स्क्रिप्ट थी?	0
बच्चे गुस्सा कर रहे हैं।	0
लीड मैन करिश्मा-मुक्त है।	0
किसी भी स्तर पर योग्यता के बिना, यह यातना के समान है।	0
मैं इसे फिर से कहूँगा - यह यातना है।	0
शायद इस अत्याचार के लिए एक उचित स्पष्टीकरण होगा।	0
आत्म-खोज की सुखद यात्रा नहीं।	0
अत्यधिक अप्राप्य।	0
यदि यह आधार ध्वनि को बेवकूफ बनाता है, तो ऐसा इसलिए है क्योंकि यह है।	0
हाँ, यह बुरा है।	0
सिफारिश करने के लिए कुछ भी नहीं है।	0
सुश्री का एक उत्कृष्ट प्रदर्शन	1
गार्बो, जिन्होंने बल्ले से सही दिखाया कि उनकी प्रतिभा मूक युग से आगे बढ़ सकती है (मैं उनके कुछ मूक काम देखना चाहता था, लेकिन नेटफ्लिक्स उन्हें स्टॉक नहीं करता है।	1
यह देखकर भी बहुत अच्छा लगा कि प्रसिद्ध मूक पटकथा लेखक फ्रांसेस मैरियन ने मूक से ध्वनि की ओर जाने वाले एक कदम को याद नहीं किया है।	1
इस फिल्म को लेखन की वजह से नुकसान हुआ, इसे और अधिक सस्पेंस की आवश्यकता थी।	0
बहुत सारे नज़दीकियां थीं।	0
लेकिन इसके अलावा फिल्म को खींचना प्रतीत होता था और नायक वास्तव में अपनी स्वतंत्रता के लिए काम नहीं करते थे।	0
लेकिन यह फिल्म निश्चित रूप से औसत किराए से नीचे है।	0
&quot;आपको बहुत पसंद आएगा!	1
यह फिल्म BAD है।	0
बहुत बुरा।	0
फिल्म वैसे भी बहुत लंबी है।	0
यह निश्चित रूप से बुरे लोगों में से एक है।	0
मुझे जो फिल्म मिली, वह उम्र के हिसाब से एक बेहतरीन फिल्म थी।	1
जॉन वेन ने फिल्म उद्योग में इतने युवा होने के लिए एक अविश्वसनीय काम किया।	1
स्क्रीन पर उनकी मौजूदगी ने सोचा कि भले ही उनके साथ स्क्रीन पर अन्य वरिष्ठ अभिनेता थे।	1
मुझे लगता है कि यह एक पुरानी जॉन वेन फिल्म को देखना चाहिए।	1
मैं वास्तव में यह नहीं देखता कि कोई भी इस फिल्म का आनंद कैसे ले सकता है।	0
मुझे नहीं लगता कि मैंने कभी इस कबाड़ के स्व-भोग के रूप में उबाऊ फिल्म देखी है।	0
यह शायद बेहतर होता अगर निर्देशक अपनी कला के काम को दिखाने के लिए ज्यादातर फिल्म खर्च नहीं करते, जो वास्तव में यह उल्लेखनीय नहीं है।	0
एक और बात जो मुझे अच्छी नहीं लगी, वह यह है कि जब कोई पात्र चेहरे पर मुक्का मारता है, तो खून का एक गैलन आगे निकल जाता है।	0
जेमी फॉक्सक्स बिल्कुल आईएस रे चार्ल्स है।	1
उनका प्रदर्शन बस प्रतिभा है।	1
वह फिल्म के मालिक हैं, जैसे कि स्पेसक के पास &quot;कोल माइनर डॉटर&quot; और क्विड के पास &quot;ग्रेट बॉल्स ऑफ फायर&quot; का स्वामित्व है।	1
&quot;वास्तव में, यह याद रखना मुश्किल है कि रे चार्ल्स के हिस्से पर कार्रवाई की जा रही है, न कि खुद उस व्यक्ति द्वारा निभाई गई है।	1
रे चार्ल्स दिग्गज हैं।	1
रे चार्ल्स के जीवन ने फिल्म के लिए उत्कृष्ट जीवनी संबंधी सामग्री प्रदान की, जो एक संगीतकार के बारे में सिर्फ एक और फिल्म होने से परे है।	1
हिचकॉक एक महान निर्देशक हैं।	1
विडंबना यह है कि मुझे ज्यादातर उनकी फिल्में देखने के लिए समय की कुल बर्बादी लगती हैं।	0
दूसरी बात, हिचकॉक ने थ्रिलर और चेस मूवी को बहुत पर्फेक्ट किया।	1
यह दर्शकों के लिए है जो उनकी अधिकांश फिल्मों में तोड़फोड़ करता है।	0
इसलिए पूरी कहानी में एक निश्चित ऊर्जा का अभाव है।	0
साजिश बस मशीन की तरह बड़बड़ाती है, नए दृश्यों के अतिरिक्त पर पूरी तरह से निर्भर करती है।	0
सामान्य हिचकॉक तर्क दोष हैं।	0
मिशिमा अत्यंत अविनीत है।	0
यह एक मिर्ची, एक अमूर्त फिल्म है, जो एक लेखक के बारे में है, जो कि एक मिर्च की संस्कृति में रहती है / काम करती है।	0
फ्लैट पुनर्विकास आपका ध्यान आकर्षित नहीं करता है क्योंकि वे भावनात्मक रूप से अपमानजनक और डगमगाते हैं।	0
और इसके बाकी हिस्से वहीं विस्मयकारी हो जाते हैं ... सैनिकों के साथ मर्दानगी के बारे में गीत गाते हुए वे खुद को प्रतिज्ञा देते हैं, पवित्रता के बारे में बाल पकड़ते हैं, तलवारों की प्रशंसा करते हैं, आदि।	0
वह आपको टुकड़ों में बोर कर सकता है, और किसी और की तुलना में जल्दी फिल्म की गति को मार सकता है।	0
श्रेडर ने घटिया, शौकिया फिल्मों से भरा एक फिर से शुरू किया है।	0
जब मैंने पहली बार 80 के दशक में यह फिल्म देखी थी, तो मुझे बहुत अच्छा लगा।	1
मैं पूरी तरह से संगीत, नृत्य ... सब पर मोहित हो गया।	1
हालाँकि, मैंने हाल ही में डीवीडी पर पूरी बात फिर से देखी, और मैं पूरी तरह से चकित रह गया कि कहानी कितनी बेतुकी है - इसमें कैसे छेद, विसंगतियाँ और - खुलकर - पूरी तरह से बकवास - और कितना भयानक नृत्य था।	0
मेरा मतलब है, एक यथार्थवादी दुनिया में, वह कभी भी उस बैले प्रदर्शनों में नहीं गई होगी ... पूरी बात काफी दयनीय थी।	0
चरित्र विकास में भी गहराई का अभाव था।	0
Woa, भयानक के बारे में बात करते हैं।	0
अपना समय बर्बाद मत करो।	0
यह बहुत भयानक था।	0
सबसे खराब, नीरस संवाद ... मैं आगे और आगे बढ़ सकता था।	0
लेकिन वास्तव में जो इसे अलिखित बनाता था वह था दिशा।	0
बेचारे एक्टर।	0
आप यह भी नहीं बता सकते हैं कि क्या उनके पास कोई प्रतिभा है क्योंकि उनके पास न केवल बोलने के लिए दयनीय लाइनें हैं, लेकिन निर्देशक ने उन्हें कोई कार्रवाई नहीं दी।	0
यदि आप इस साइट पर निर्देशक की फिल्मोग्राफी की जांच करते हैं, तो आप देखेंगे कि इस फिल्म को मौका क्यों नहीं मिला।	0
यह टीवी फ्लिक के लिए भी अच्छा नहीं होगा।	0
अगर अच्छे इरादों से कोई फिल्म बनती है, तो यह फिल्म अब तक की सबसे महान फिल्मों में से एक हो सकती है।	1
फिल्म में महान कलाकार, एक मास्टर निर्देशक, एक महत्वपूर्ण विषय - कम से कम एक महत्वपूर्ण विषय होगा, अर्द्धशतक अस्तित्व-संबंधी विश्व-थकावट, हवाई दृश्य, जो दोनों इंद्रियों और कल्पनाओं को रोमांचित करने के लिए चाहिए, और पात्रों के बारे में एक हो सकता है गहराई से देखभाल।	1
अफसोस कि फिल्म असफल हो जाती है।	0
फिल्म में कथा के बारे में बहुत ही देशभक्ति के दृश्य रुचि, नाटक, भाव की अभिव्यक्ति और उत्सव का अभाव है।	0
इस फिल्म में उस जून एलीसन का उपयोग करने के लिए किसी भी अभिनेत्री को बदतर नहीं किया गया है।	0
फिर भी, मुझे इसे देखने में मज़ा आता है।	1
दुर्भाग्य से, यह एक खराब फिल्म है जो सिर्फ सादा खराब है।	0
बुरी स्क्रिप्ट, बुरी दिशा और भयानक अभिनय इस एक को बुरा बनाते हैं!	0

मुझे गुस्सा आ रहा था।	0
*** SPOILERS *** इसके बारे में और कुछ भी (या नहीं) कहा जा सकता है, सर्फ़स शानदार रूप से गढ़ा गया है।	1
सिनेमैटोग्राफी केवल आश्चर्यजनक है (कम से कम कहने के लिए) और एफएक्स कुछ भी नहीं हैं अगर अत्याधुनिक नहीं हैं।	1
वैचारिक रूप से, यह शो हर चीज के लिए थोड़ा-बहुत प्रदान करता है- और हर किसी के बारे में (माता-पिता, बच्चे, कल्पना और / या एफएक्स प्रशंसकों के लिए)।	1
और अभिनय के लिहाज से एक भी खट्टा नोट नहीं था; कुछ आश्चर्यजनक रूप से ठोस कास्टिंग, यहाँ।	1
सभी चीजों पर विचार किया, एक नौकरी बहुत अच्छी तरह से किया।	1
धन्यवाद अच्छी तरह से एक फिल्म की गई और रिलीज हुई।	1
अब तक की सबसे बेहतरीन मैक्सिकन फिल्मों में से एक !, और कम समझ वाले लोगों में से एक, यहां तक कि खुद को मैक्सिकन द्वारा भी नहीं पहचाना गया है, भले ही इसके साथ महसूस किया गया हो।	1
यह एक महान नोइर-क्राइम-ड्रामा, बेलमंडो और लिनो वेंचुरा द्वारा अविश्वसनीय प्रदर्शन के रूप में उच्च रैंक करता है।	1
हर चरित्र पर ध्यान दिया जाता है, और जटिल मनोवैज्ञानिक चित्रण, वफादारी, विश्वासघात, प्रेम और आशा का विस्तार करते हैं, जबरदस्त हैं।	1
यह एक उत्कृष्ट नाटक, एक उत्कृष्ट थ्रिलर और एक उत्कृष्ट फिल्म है।	1
वहाँ मेलविले के सर्वश्रेष्ठ के साथ।	1
इस फिल्म के बारे में सब कुछ बस अविश्वसनीय है।	1
आप सही मायने में इस यात्रा को एक बच्चे की आंखों और आत्मा के माध्यम से लेते हैं।	1
ब्लैक वॉटर एक ऐसा थ्रिलर है जो लगातार तीव्र अनुभवों के रूप में उभरने की अपेक्षाओं को तोड़-मरोड़ कर इसे पूरी तरह से सीमित कर देता है (यह इंडी फ्लिक है)।	1
प्रदर्शन वास्तविक और मनोरंजक हैं, मगरमच्छ बहुत अच्छी तरह से किया जाता है, वास्तव में अगर ब्लैक वाटर वेबसाइट पर विश्वास किया जाए तो ऐसा इसलिए है क्योंकि वे वास्तविक crocs का इस्तेमाल करते हैं और दलदली स्थान शानदार है।	1
जब क्रिस्टोफर एक्लेस्टोन ने टैरिस और श्रृंखला की निरंतरता पर नियंत्रण कर लिया, तो मैंने इसका पूरा आनंद लिया।	1
मुझे यकीन नहीं है कि वह इस फिल्म के साथ क्या करने की कोशिश कर रहा था।	0
अगर यह मेरे अच्छे दिन की भावनाओं को परेशान करने वाली यादों की एक रात में बदल देता, तो मुझे लगता है कि वह सफल हो गया।	0

संभवतः सभी समय के सर्वश्रेष्ठ त्रयी के लिए एक अद्भुत समापन!	1
Kieslowski मुझे विस्मित करना बंद नहीं करता है।	1
वह मेरे पसंदीदा निर्देशकों में से एक हैं, और सिनेमा के इतिहास में सबसे प्रतिभाशाली निर्देशकों में से एक हैं।	1
तीनों फ़िल्मों में फ्रेंच झंडे के रंगों का उनका प्रयोग अविश्वसनीय नहीं था, हर शॉट, हर दृश्य कला के काम की तरह था।	1
सबसे ज्यादा दिखने वाली तीन फिल्में मैंने कभी देखी हैं।	1
और तीन फिल्मों के बीच उनके सूक्ष्म संबंध कमाल के हैं।	1
मुझे इसका उल्लेख करना है और यह एक बहुत बड़ा जासूस है, मुझे अंत से प्यार है, कैसे तीनों फिल्मों के सभी पात्र फेरी आपदा के बचे हुए थे, वेलेंटाइन और युवा जज के साथ, और बूढ़ा आदमी उसे देख रहा था टीवी, उन दुखों पर अपनी खुशी को मजबूत करता है जो उन्होंने उन कई वर्षों से निपटाए थे।	1
मैं फिल्म को खत्म करने का एक बेहतर तरीका नहीं सोच सकता था, लेकिन मेरे चेहरे पर एक मुस्कान, एक अद्भुत फिल्म और त्रयी को लपेटने का शानदार तरीका!	1
मैं हर किसी के लिए यह सलाह देता हूं जो फिल्म, फिल्में, कुछ भी प्यार करता है ... ए वर्क ऑफ आर्ट!	1
मूवी और ट्राइलॉजी दोनों के लिए 10 में से 10।	1
मैंने सचमुच इस फिल्म को देखते हुए उल्टी की।	0
मुझे लगता है कि मैं उन लोगों में से एक था, जिन्हें यह एक और मोती के मोती मिले।	1
जैसा कि उनका प्रदर्शन, शानदार था।	1
25 साल पहले फ्रांसिस फोर्ड कोप्पोला ने जो कहानी इतनी स्पष्ट रूप से कही थी, वह वास्तव में धीरे-धीरे सामने आती है और पात्रों को विकसित करने के लिए जगह छोड़ देती है।	1
सबसे अद्भुत स्थान में इसके विपरीत की कहानी है।	1
निकोला की राग विह से एक सुंदर निर्देशित फिल्म में सभी ने एक उदात्त कास्ट किया।	1
मैं एक जीने के लिए फिल्मों का अनुवाद कर रहा हूं और यह मेरे 5 साल के काम के अनुभव की पहली फिल्म है जिसे मैंने अपनी बुद्धिमत्ता के लिए आक्रामक पाया।	0
लेकिन जब कोई महानता और कविता के लिए प्रयास करता है, लेकिन एक असभ्य (और अक्सर हास्यास्पद) कहानी देता है, असमान दृश्यों का एक गुच्छा, दिखावापूर्ण संवाद ... तब आपको सबसे खराब तरह की फिल्म मिलती है जिसे कुछ अन्य समीक्षक &quot;सटीक&quot; के रूप में परिभाषित करते हैं बकवास &quot;।	0
उन लोगों को जो इस फिल्म को बुद्धिमान या यहां तक कि निपुण पाते हैं, मैं केवल यह कह सकता हूं - यह आपकी बुद्धिमत्ता है और आपकी कल्पना है कि आप स्पष्ट रूप से इस दयनीय प्रयास की कोशिश करते थे और यह (चीजों को समझने की कोशिश करना हमारे मानव स्वभाव में है)।	0
एक और बात: मैं राजनीतिक गलतता को बहुत अच्छी तरह से सहन कर सकता हूं, मैं सभी कलात्मक स्वतंत्रता और अविश्वास के निलंबन के लिए हूं, लेकिन स्लाव महिला चरित्र अभी बहुत ज्यादा था।	0
यह इतनी मजेदार और मजेदार फिल्म है।	1
सभी कोणों पर अत्यधिक मनोरंजक।	1
इसमें यादगार, मानसिक लेकिन प्यारा नट की एक बाहरी विशेषता है।	1
इसलिए हमारे आनंद के लिए हमें उन्हें इधर-उधर भागते, खेल खेलते और खतरनाक होते हुए देखना होगा।	1
यहां तक कि इसके मधुर क्षण भी हैं।	1
टेलीफोन मरम्मत आदमी वास्तव में अजीब था और पागल और कुतिया मालिक के लिए उसकी प्रतिक्रियाएं वास्तव में वास्तविक थीं।	1
इस फिल्म के सभी किरदार जबरदस्त तरीके से निभाए गए हैं।	1
और मैं वास्तव में उन्हें अजीब लगा।	1
यह वास्तव में एक बहुत ही स्मार्ट फिल्म है।	1
एक शानदार मोड़ समाप्त हो रहा है।	1
&quot; मुझे यह पसंद है।	1
अंत इतना है, तो सही है ... आप एक आंसू बहाएंगे।	1
इस तरह की फिल्म देखकर मैं बहुत रोमांचित हूं।	1
मैं इसे अब कभी नहीं भूलूंगा।	1

इस फिल्म को नाटक कहना हास्यास्पद है!	0
यह देखना शुरू किया, लेकिन किसी भी पात्र पर विश्वास नहीं किया।	0
विशेष रूप से बेकरी सहायक और वेट्रेस के बीच संबंध मेरे लिए बिल्कुल भी काम नहीं करते थे।	0
यह एक बहुत ही सतही फिल्म थी और इसने मुझे यह एहसास दिलाया कि मैं फिल्म के बजाय नाटक देख रहा था।	0
पात्र बहुत a रंगमंचीय ’थे और कथानक बहुत हद तक मंचीय था।	0
उस समय तक जब तक मैं सहायक नहीं था, तब तक pyromaniac waylid और मुझे परवाह नहीं थी कि मैं आगे क्या हुआ।	0
खुशी है कि मैंने इसे देखने के लिए भुगतान नहीं किया।	0

यह देखने के लिए बहुत अच्छा शो है।	1

जिस आदमी ने कहा कि उसके पौधों के साथ उसका बेहतर संवाद है, यह सही है।	0

अगर आपको बुरी फिल्में पसंद हैं, तो भी इस फिल्म को न देखें।	0
यह शर्मनाक है।	0
अगर मैं कर सकता तो मैं इस टेलीविजन सीरीज़ को 10 प्लस देता।	1
लेखक &quot;स्मैक ऑन&quot; थे और मुझे लगता है कि सर्वश्रेष्ठ अभिनेता और अभिनेत्रियाँ शो के लिए एक बोनस थे। ये पात्र इतने वास्तविक थे।	1
मुझे कहना होगा कि मैंने अधिकांश एपिसोड टैप किए हैं और मैं खुद को बार-बार देख रहा हूं।	1
अब आप जानते हैं कि मैंने इसे 10+ क्यों दिया!	1
मुझे ठीक से पता नहीं है कि यह इस फिल्म के बारे में क्या है, लेकिन हमने इस प्रेमपूर्ण फिल्म को देखा और यह हमारे परिवार की यादों का एक खास हिस्सा बन गया है।	1
मैं पूरी तरह से और पूरी तरह से इस फिल्म को किसी को भी देने की सलाह देता हूं, जो अच्छी पौष्टिक पारिवारिक फिल्में पसंद करता है क्योंकि यही वास्तव में है।	1
चार बच्चों को जो चीजें अपने आप में मिलती हैं, वह देखने में बिल्कुल प्रफुल्लित करने वाला है।	1
यह उन सर्वश्रेष्ठ फिल्मों में से एक है जो एक दूसरे के लिए इस तरह के मजबूत बंधन को दर्शाती हैं।	1
बहुत अधिक दिलचस्प, अधिक कार्रवाई, अधिक रहस्य और अनावश्यक विवाद का कम।	1
अभिनय से लेकर सिनेमैटोग्राफी तक सब कुछ ठोस था।	1
निश्चित रूप से जाँच के लायक है।	1
डेमियन स्क्रीन पर विभिन्न वर्णों को लिखने और चित्रित करने के इतने तरीकों में बहुत प्रतिभाशाली और बहुमुखी है।	1
इस फिल्म के लिए एक अत्याधुनिक है।	1
मुझे यह जानकर बहुत खुशी हो रही है कि इस तरह के एक आधुनिक दिन की प्रतिभा बाहर है, कला के प्रति जुनून उसे ड्राइव कर रहा है और हमें एक दर्शक के रूप में अपने साथ ले रहा है।	1
नए पात्र वे सभी यादगार नहीं थे, और मैंने पाया कि कौन है कौन।	0
मुझे लगा कि जैसे आयरलैंड जा रही है उसने बिल्कुल कुछ नहीं किया।	0
इसने मुझे डराया, भयभीत नहीं किया, या पात्रों के प्रति सहानुभूति नहीं दिखाई; यह बस कष्टप्रद था।	0
झटकेदार कैमरे की हरकत भी परेशान करने वाली थी।	0
साजिश हर दूसरे सस्ते हॉरर के समान थी।	0
पात्रों को कुछ गहराई देने के लिए कुछ दयनीय प्रयास थे, लेकिन यह वास्तव में बाकी कथानक में काम नहीं आया।	0
मुझे लगता है कि यह चतुर मोड़ होना चाहिए था, फिर स्थिति पर कुछ प्रकाश डाला, लेकिन यह सिर्फ बेवकूफ था।	0
यदि आप इसे देखते हैं, तो आपको संभवतः इसे शेल्फ पर छोड़ देना चाहिए।	0
इलायस कोटेस, जैक पैलेंस ने अच्छी भूमिकाएँ निभाईं। एंजेलीना हॉट हैं और नग्न हो जाती हैं। बिली ड्रैगो इसमें दिखाई देते हैं और हमेशा की तरह शांत हैं। स्वेन ओले थोरसेन द्वारा किया गया एक कैमियो अच्छे अभिनय और एक अच्छे बजट के साथ यह एक बहुत ही सुखद फिल्म बनाने में मदद करता है।	1
यह इतनी कमाल की फिल्म थी कि मैंने इसे एबे से खरीद लिया।	1
मैं वास्तव में कहानी लाइन से प्यार करता था और पोलर भालू थोड़े प्यारा था। लेकिन अगर किसी के पास फोर्ट स्टील के बारे में कोई सवाल है, तो उससे पूछें :)	1
यह पूरी तरह से UNfunny फिल्म शीर्ष और दयनीय और अवास्तविक से अधिक है कि पूरे 90 मिनट की अत्याचार यातना के दौरान मैंने लगभग 70000 बार अपनी घड़ी देखी!	0
लुसी बेल इस बकवास से बहुत अधिक है और उसके लिए यह कम सिंक काफी निराशाजनक है।	0
यह सब फिल्म आपको बीमार बनाती है इन सभी आलसियों को देखकर 90 मिनट के लिए अपनी बेवकूफी भरी हरकतें करने का बहाना बनाते हैं।	0
भगवान, और मैं उस ९ ० मिनट पहले कभी नहीं मिल सकता!	0
मुझे लगता है कि सबसे अद्भुत भागों (शाब्दिक, &quot;आश्चर्य&quot; से भरा) उनके कार्यों के अंश हैं।	1
सेट (विशेष रूप से कैमरे के साथ काम करने के लिए डिज़ाइन किए गए) अद्भुत हैं .... स्टाइलिश, सुंदर और प्रभावी।	1
वे किसी भी सेट डिजाइनर के लिए अनुकरणीय के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है।	1
कहानियाँ मनुष्य के स्वभाव और कला के शक्तिशाली अन्वेषण थे।	1
इस फिल्म को देखने के बाद, मैं इस कलाकार के कामों के बारे में और जानना चाहता था।	1
मैं कला, कविता, रंगमंच, राजनीति या जापानी इतिहास में रुचि रखने वाले किसी भी व्यक्ति के लिए इस फिल्म की अत्यधिक अनुशंसा करता हूं।	1
यहाँ, द विंड एंड द लायन में, हमें अमेरिका की अपनी शाही उम्र का अद्भुत प्रतिपादन दिखाई देता है।	1
) क्या इस कहानी को अलग बनाती है भयानक उत्पादन मूल्य - दोषपूर्ण फोटोग्राफी, रचना और संपादन - भयानक कास्टिंग - एक छोटे से टेडी - और ज्वलंत इतिहास खेलते हुए ब्रायन कीथ की अनदेखी।	1
हालाँकि द विंड एंड द लायन को बड़े पैमाने पर बेटे की आँखों के माध्यम से बताया जाता है, परिवार का हर सदस्य किसी एक पात्र से पहचान सकता है, चाहे वह सीन कॉनरी का रईस ब्रिगेड हो, कैंडेस बर्गन की सामंती नायिका, जॉन हैनॉन की पत्नी जॉन हे या स्टीव कनाल का spiffy, radiant, निर्मम कैन-डू लेफ्टिनेंट, रूजवेल्ट की &quot;बिग स्टिक&quot;।	1
यह अपने सर्वश्रेष्ठ में उच्च साहसिक है।	1
मुझे लगता है कि यह रॉबर्ट रियांस की सबसे अच्छी फिल्म थी, क्योंकि उन्होंने मेरे पिता की तरह किसी को चित्रित किया था, और वह वास्तविक जीवन में एक सिज़ोफ्रेनिक थे, (मेरे पिता) हालांकि उन्होंने कभी किसी की हत्या नहीं की, लेकिन दूसरे विश्व युद्ध के दौरान इससे अधिक प्रभावित हुए जिससे उनकी स्थिति और खराब हो गई।	1
दिन के माध्यम से प्राप्त करने और प्राप्त करने के लिए उसे मज़ाक करना इतना उपयुक्त था।	1
(मेरी मां और भाई को ऐसा करना पड़ा) जब मैंने रॉबर्ट रयान को इस प्रकार के व्यक्ति को चित्रित करते हुए देखा, तो यह इस प्रकार के व्यक्ति की बहुत अच्छी नकल थी, और मैं प्रभावित हुआ।	1
कवर गर्ल के लगभग सभी गाने पुराने ढंग के हैं और बहुत सुरीले नहीं हैं।	0
Girl कवर गर्ल ’के बारे में सबसे ज्यादा परेशान करने वाली बात यह है कि रीता हयवर्थ को किस तरह से पैदल किया जाता है।	0
दुर्भाग्य से, &#39;कवर गर्ल&#39; इस बात का उदाहरण है कि हॉलीवुड ने वित्तीय लाभ के लिए महिलाओं का शोषण कैसे किया।	0
गैर-रेखीय कथन इस प्रकार कई फ्लैशबैक और हर भाग को काफी अच्छी तरह से व्यक्त किया गया है।	1
अच्छी सिनेमेटोग्राफी भी उन्हें और मोनिका बेलुची को बहुत खूबसूरत लगती है।	1
आज के प्यार की एक अच्छी टिप्पणी और निस्संदेह एक फिल्म देखने लायक है।	1
उन लोगों के लिए जो फिल्म निर्माण में पहली बार हैं, मुझे लगता है कि उन्होंने एक उत्कृष्ट काम किया है !!	1
यह बहुत लोकप्रिय था जब मैं सिनेमा में था, एक अच्छा घर और बहुत अच्छी प्रतिक्रियाएं और बहुत सारी हंसी।	1
यह एक अच्छी-अच्छी फिल्म है और जब मैंने सिनेमा से बाहर आया तो मुझे कैसा लगा!	1
यह उस समुदाय के बारे में उत्तरी हास्य और सकारात्मक है जो इसका प्रतिनिधित्व करता है।	1
मैंने बल्कि इसका आनंद लिया।	1
मुझे अच्छा लगा।	1
मैं उन्हें गंभीरता से नहीं ले सकता था।	0
यह वास्तव में एक अनोखी भावना पैदा करता है।	1
विवियन शिलिंग ने स्क्रिप्ट के साथ एक उत्कृष्ट काम किया।	1
आज सिनेमाघरों में 95% से ज्यादा बेहतर दुनिया है।	1
उसकी भूमिका अच्छी थी।	1
बहुत मर्दाना नहीं बल्कि सिर्फ सही चीखना।	1
इस फिल्म में कैमरा वास्तव में उसे पसंद करता है।	1
मैंने स्क्रिप्ट तैयार करने के बाद उसे उस भूमिका में कास्ट किया होगा।	1
एक यूरोपीय के रूप में, फिल्म 1980 के दशक में एक छात्र के रूप में मेरे अनुभव और विदेश में रह रहे अनुभवों और अन्य राष्ट्रीयताओं के साथ बातचीत करने के लिए मेरे लिए एक अच्छा मौका है, हालांकि हालात थोड़े अलग थे।	1
मैं उनका प्रशंसक हूं ... इस फिल्म ने वास्तव में खराब चूसा।	0
टिकर से भी बदतर!	0
&amp; वह फिल्म खराब थी।	0
केवल 3 या 4 इमारतों का उपयोग किया जाता है, स्थानों की एक जोड़ी MAYBE, और खराब हम्म!	0
यह सिर्फ उड़ा दिया।	0
यह फिल्म उत्कृष्ट है! एंजेल सुंदर है और स्कैम्प आराध्य है! हिचकिचाहट होने पर उसकी छोटी-छोटी येल्प्स, और सबसे मजेदार भाग तब होते हैं: स्कैम्प को पर्दे के नीचे पकड़ा जाता है और जब एंजेल और स्कैम्प गाते हैं &#39;Ive Never Had This Feeling before&#39;.I पूरी तरह से इस फिल्म की सिफारिश करते हैं, इसके 20 जून को विशेष संस्करण में आ रहे हैं। कवर में कचरे के डिब्बे पर स्क्रैम्प है और एंजेल ढक्कन के नीचे है।	1
मैं सिर्फ इस फिल्म को रोमांटिक, आकर्षक, प्रफुल्लित, और मनमोहक से अधिक नहीं समझा सकता हूँ। कबाड़ वाले दृश्य मज़ेदार हैं, सभी कबाड़ के कुत्तों के पास कुछ विशेष है। यह मज़ेदार मुझे हँसाता है, बच्चे इसे प्यार करेंगे। लेकिन जब यह सामने आता है, तो यह होता है। नए विशेषताएँ!	1
अब हमें इस घृणित अमेरिकी प्रचार के घृणित टुकड़े के साथ अत्याचार करने के लिए चुना गया था।	0
यह शो अमेरिकियों के लिए बनाया गया है - यह बहुत बेवकूफी भरा है और घृणा और क्लिच के साथ कहीं और भर्ती होने के लिए।	0
इसमें शामिल लगभग सभी को स्कूल में वापस जाना चाहिए, अभिनय पूरी तरह से अनुमानित और खराब है, स्क्रिप्ट पूरे दौर में कचरे का ढेर है।	0
काश मैं नकारात्मक मूल्यों, प्रवेश कर सकता हूँ?	0
सेट बहुत खराब हैं, वे थंडरबर्ड्स एपिसोड में जगह से बाहर नहीं दिखेंगे।	0
धीमी गति वाली गति का उपयोग पूरी फिल्म में खुद को दोहराता है, लेकिन खराब अभिनय द्वारा अच्छी तरह से समर्थित है (और बुरा एक तरह का शब्द है), कोई निरंतरता नहीं है, ऐसे दृश्य जो बिना किसी कारण के लिए फेंक दिए जाते हैं, जो वाहनों की तरह दिखते थे जैसे वे बनाए गए थे एक मकई के गुच्छे बॉक्स और एक निर्देशकीय शैली जो मूर्खता पर सीमाबद्ध थी।	0
अरे हाँ, और कहानी भी दयनीय थी।	0
मुझे फिल्मों के बारे में खराब समीक्षा लिखने से नफरत है - विशेष रूप से उन जिनमें मैं वास्तव में स्टार को पसंद करता हूं - लेकिन यह फिल्म इतनी बुरी है कि मैं एक सेकंड के लिए विश्वास नहीं करता कि किसी को भी इस पर गर्व हो सकता था।	0
मैं एक फिल्म निर्माता नहीं हूं और न ही मैं निर्देशक हूं, लेकिन अगर मैं इस फिल्म में जितना भी पैसा और समय खर्च करूंगा, मैं अपना सिर रेत में छिपाऊंगा।	0
संक्षेप में - यह समय और ऊर्जा का एक अपव्यय था और मैं किसी को भी इस फिल्म को देखने की सिफारिश नहीं करूंगा।	0
यह मेरे द्वारा खरीदे गए डीवीडी प्लेयर के साथ मुफ्त आया था, लेकिन मैंने अभी भी इस चीज को आधे रास्ते से बंद कर दिया क्योंकि मैं हॉवेल के लिए शर्मिंदा था।	0
1/10 - और केवल इसलिए कि 0/10 के लिए कोई सेटिंग नहीं है।	0
एक दिलचस्प आधार, और बिली Drago हमेशा एक खतरनाक अखरोट-बैग (साइड नोट: मैं Drago, स्टीफन McHattie और लांस Hendrikson एक साथ एक झटका में देखने के लिए प्यार करता हूँ के साथ अच्छा है!	1
साउंडट्रैक भयानक नहीं था, या तो।	1
लेकिन अभिनय - यहां तक कि Drago और डेबी Rochon जैसे पेशेवरों के लिए - भयानक था, निर्देशन बदतर (शायद पूर्व में योगदानकर्ता), संवाद चिम्प-जैसा, और कैमरा काम, मुश्किल से सहनीय।	0
फिर भी, यह SETS था जिसे मेरे &quot;ओय-वे&quot; पैमाने पर एक बड़ा &quot;10&quot; मिला।	1
हां, मैं यहां संक्षिप्तता के लिए चीजों को सरल बना रहा हूं, इसके लिए वास्तव में इस फिल्म के साथ समस्याओं का मूल है - यह बहुत अधिक है बिना किसी वास्तविक, पूर्ण विवरण के।	0
दोनों अच्छी नौकरी करते हैं और काफी मनोरंजक हैं।	1
लेकिन दृढ़ कथानक ने मुझे आश्वस्त नहीं किया, और फिल्म को बहुत कुछ अजीब, सवालिया नज़र से देखा गया।	0
मैंने अपनी प्रेमिका को यह देखने के लिए बोला - बुरा विचार है, हम दोनों इससे नफरत करते थे।	0
आखिरी 15 मिनट की फिल्म भी खराब नहीं है।	1
बेला लुगोसी पूरी तरह से बहिर्मुखी थी, जो विषम रेखाओं को जोड़ती थी।	0
अभिनय काफी हद तक लकड़ी का था, हालांकि यूनिवर्सल बी फिल्म की तुलना में कोई भी बदतर नहीं है।	0
मुझे आर्मंड असांटे पसंद है और मेरी केबल कंपनी का सारांश दिलचस्प लग रहा था, इसलिए मैंने इसे देखा, दो बार पहले से ही, और शायद फिर से।	1
मेरा मानना है कि पटकथा लेखक ने ढीले छोरों को बांधने का अच्छा काम किया।	1
मेरा 8/10 स्कोर ज्यादातर प्लॉट के लिए है।	1
मैं किसी भी अधिक नहीं कहूंगा - मुझे स्पॉइलर पसंद नहीं है, इसलिए मैं एक नहीं बनना चाहता, लेकिन मेरा मानना है कि यह फिल्म आपके समय के लायक है।	1
वाह, क्या खराब फिल्म है।	0
कम से कम में भयावह नहीं, और बमुश्किल समझ में आता है।	0
कथानक बिल्कुल एक साथ नहीं लटकता है, और अभिनय बिल्कुल भयावह है।	0
शिविर मूल्य के लिए भी अच्छा नहीं है!	0
मुझे ऑस्कर सामग्री की उम्मीद नहीं थी, लेकिन यह?	0
आपके पास विशेष रूप से बेवकूफ मोलस्क का आईक्यू होना चाहिए जो कि आने वाले को न देख सके।	0
यह फिल्म (और मैं उस शब्द का शिथिल उपयोग करता हूं) फिल्म-गोइंग पब्लिक का अपमान है।	0
यदि केवल इसके साथ जुड़े किसी को पता था कि कथा को एक साथ कैसे पिरोया जाए!	0
यह 10 में से 1 प्राप्त करता है, केवल इसलिए कि कुछ भी कम नहीं है।	0
यह वह है जो मेरे पास नहीं था, लेकिन मैंने इसे हाल ही में फॉक्स मूवी चैनल पर देखा था, और बहुत निराश था।	0
मुझे पता है कि वह अपनी स्क्रिप्ट पर थोड़ा नियंत्रण रखने वाला एक अनुबंध खिलाड़ी था, लेकिन अभिनय स्क्रिप्ट की तरह खराब था।	0
विक्टर मैकलगलेन और भी बुरा था, और ब्रायन डोनलेवी लगभग पहचान में नहीं आ रहा था।	0
टेलर और स्टैनविक के बीच संबंधों को पर्दे पर देखते हुए, यह आश्चर्य की बात थी कि उन दोनों के बीच स्क्रीन पर कितनी छोटी रसायन विज्ञान थी।	0
लेकिन फिल्म का आधार इतना हास्यास्पद था: कि अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति	0
मृत्यु पंक्ति के दृश्य पूरी तरह से असहनीय थे।	0
टेलर की एक्टिंग से भी बदतर चीज थी स्टैनविक का गायन।	0
जो भी निर्माता के लिए जा रहा था, वह पूरी तरह से याद किया।	0
मैं उनके द्वारा निभाए गए किरदार से काफी प्रभावित था।	1
मुझे पता था कि जब मैंने फिल्म देखी थी कि इस प्रतिभाशाली अभिनेता से अधिक महान चीजें आनी थीं।	1
घटिया चरित्र-चित्रण के साथ एक सस्ती और हँसरहित फिल्म, बहुत सारी अंडरबाइट शैली का भावुक होना (थिंक यूं फैट इन ए बेटर टुमॉरो) और कुछ ख़ूबसूरत क्लिच को एक खराब फैक्ट्री में उड़ने वाले जूडो रोल के लिए तैयार जॉन लु में लाए गए कारखाने में फेंक दिया गया।	0
यहां तक कि स्क्विब भयानक दिखते हैं।	0
कार्यवाही के किसी भी बिंदु पर यह अमेरिका की तरह दूर से नहीं दिखता है।	0
कथानक, जैसे कि यह है, इतना व्युत्पन्न और अनुमानित है कि अंत एक दया हत्या की तरह है।	0
हर कोई अंतरिक्ष और समय की वास्तविक बर्बादी को गोली मार देता है, जो भयानक संवाद और निराशाजनक है।	0
मैं इस बात से बहुत असहज था कि यह फिल्म कितनी बुरी थी, लेकिन बिल्कुल भी डरी हुई नहीं थी।	0
संवाद उन चीजों से बना है जो बहुत कम समझ में आती हैं।	0
लगभग 30 मिनट का फुटेज औसत दर्जे के बुजुर्ग अभिनेताओं को दिखाने के लिए बर्बाद हो जाता है, अजीब तरह से बड़बड़ाते हुए छद्म-शैतानी जिबरिश कॉर्नी को एक किशोर गोथ ब्लश बनाने के लिए पर्याप्त है, लगभग हमेशा पुरानी अंग्रेजी में, और कभी-कभी लैटिन में जो शब्द नहीं हो सकते हैं या हो सकते हैं।	0
निर्देशन सबसे अच्छा है।	0
हैकनेड लेखन, निश्चित रूप से, लेकिन खराब निर्देशन द्वारा और भी बदतर बना दिया।	0
बेशक, अभिनय ब्ला है।	0
पूरे कलाकारों द्वारा अभिनय को एक पैमाने पर रखा जा सकता है और ओवरएक्टिंग और अंडरएक्टिंग के बीच पूरी तरह से संतुलित किया जा सकता है।	0
और, अंतिम रूप से, आखिरकार, हम एक ऐसे अंत तक पहुंच जाते हैं जो बहुत अच्छा होता, इसे सक्षम लोगों ने संभाला और जेरी फालवेल ने नहीं।	0
मुझे यह फिल्म बहुत अच्छी लगी, यह एक ऐसे परिवार का बहुत बड़ा चित्रण था, जिसके पास उतार-चढ़ाव का हिस्सा था, लेकिन अंत में वे जानते थे कि उन्हें एक-दूसरे से विशेष प्यार था।	1
मैंने जैकलीन स्मिथ अभिनीत कई फिल्में देखी हैं, लेकिन मेरा भगवान यह उनके सर्वश्रेष्ठ में से एक था, हालांकि यह 12 साल पहले आया था।	1
इस फिल्म में एक ऑल-स्टार कास्ट शामिल था, और मुझे जो सबसे ज्यादा पसंद था, वह यह था कि मैंने अन्य अभिनेताओं को देखने के लिए अपनी आँखें खोलीं, जिन्हें मैंने पहले नहीं देखा था।	1
यह फिल्म लंबाई में लंबी थी, लेकिन मैंने इसके हर मिनट का आनंद लिया।	1
कुल मिलाकर मैंने इस फिल्म को 1-10 में से 10 पैमाने पर रेट किया।	1
लाइफटाइम इसे पर्याप्त रूप से प्रसारित नहीं करता है, इसलिए यदि किसी को पता है कि कौन सी दुकान इसे बेचती है तो मुझे बताएं क्योंकि यह जरूरी है।	1
मुझे विशेष रूप से अपनी संवेदना याद है संगीत के तार डोरियों द्वारा हमला किया जा रहा है जो बहुत कम चेतावनी के साथ बाहर निकल जाएगा, और यहां तक कि कम अर्थ भी।	0
बेरोजगारों को नौकरी नहीं देने के लिए सजा देने के लिए दोपहर में जांच की जाती है।	0
पूरी तरह से अलग, ख़ामोशी और ब्लैक कॉमेडी के साथ, यह एक फिल्म कुछ देखने को मिलती है, लेकिन जो लोग इसे याद करेंगे।	1
यह फिल्म अपना खुद का ब्रह्मांड बनाती है, और हर तरह से आकर्षक है।	1
लेकिन यह फिल्म वास्तव में मुझे मिली।	1
इसे देखें।	1
मुझे वास्तव में उम्मीद है कि इस फिल्म के पीछे की टीम अधिक फिल्में बनाती है, और यह कि वे अपने आप में ऐसा करते रहेंगे, कुछ अजीब शैली।	1
और मैं भूल गया: यहाँ कास्टिंग मैं शानदार है, ट्रोंड फ़ॉसा ऑर्वाग के साथ बोमसोम मैन की भूमिका में परिपूर्ण हैं, जो यह नहीं समझता कि वह कहाँ है, वह क्या कर रहा है और क्यों कर रहा है।	1
यह फिल्म 2006 में जीवन पर एक अच्छी और हास्यप्रद टिप्पणी है।	1
मुझे यह कदम सुंदर, सुखद और उत्थानकारी लगा।	1
शुरुआत में फिल्म के स्थानीय स्थलों को, जो यहाँ बफ़ेलो में फिल्माया गया था, मुझे अंतर्निर्मित कर दिया।	1
बाद में मैंने खुद को फिल्म की शक्ति में खो दिया।	1
पूरे दर्शकों ने फिल्म के समापन पर तालियां बजाईं।	1
मैंने अपने कदम में एक झुकाव, अपने दिल में खुशी और मानव जाति के लिए आशा के साथ थिएटर छोड़ दिया।	1
ड्यूरिस में एक शानदार उपस्थिति है और एक अच्छा प्रदर्शन देता है।	1
बाकी कलाकार भी अच्छा खेलते हैं।	1
सिनेमैटोग्राफी में बार्सिलोना और उसके प्रसिद्ध गौड़ी टावरों के बेहतरीन दृश्य शामिल हैं।	1
लगभग दस मिनट इस फिल्म में मुझे दूसरे विचार आने लगे।	0
इस फिल्म के माध्यम से लगभग आधा रास्ता मुझे नापसंद करने लगा।	0
जब तक फिल्म खत्म नहीं हुई, तब तक मैंने न केवल इसे नापसंद किया, मैंने इसका तिरस्कार किया।	0
इस फिल्म में जो कमी है वह एक ठोस पटकथा है।	0
स्क्रिप्ट ऐसा लगता है जैसे केवल एक मोटा मसौदा लिखा गया था और एक तैयार स्क्रिप्ट पूरी होने से पहले शूटिंग शुरू हुई थी।	0
चीजें होती हैं, चरित्र व्यक्तित्व बदलते हैं, कथानक में कोई वास्तविक कारण नहीं होता है, इसके अलावा स्क्रिप्ट इसके लिए कॉल करती है।	0
कास्ट अच्छी है।	1
उसके लिए, यह जाँच के लायक है।	1
यह शायद सबसे अधिक परेशान करने वाला शो है जिसे मैंने अपने पूरे जीवन में देखा है।	0
यह अनिश्चित रूप से सबसे कष्टप्रद और मूर्खतापूर्ण शो है जिसे मैंने कभी देखा है।	0
इसके बारे में सब कुछ सिर्फ बुरा है।	0
मुझे समझ में नहीं आ रहा था, पहली बार में कई मौसम का उल्लेख नहीं करने के लिए किस तरह का बेवकूफ इस गंदगी का उत्पादन करेगा।	0
स्क्रिप्ट खराब है, बहुत खराब है - इसमें चिकीपन और अनैतिक मजाक दोनों शामिल हैं जिन्हें आप सामान्य रूप से रेटेड आर या एनसी -17 फिल्म में देखते हैं।	0
कास्टिंग भी भयानक है, क्योंकि आप जो भी देखते हैं वह वास्तव में बहुत बुरा एक्टर्स है, अवधि।	0
अंतिम शब्द: यह शो एक वास्तविक यातना है !!	0
यह वास्तविकता से बहुत दूर की बात है।	0
वॉशिंग मशीन को घूरते हुए देखने से आपकी आँखें इस शो के रूप में ज्यादा प्रभावित नहीं होंगी।	0
रेटिंग: 0/10 (ग्रेड: जेड) नोट: शो इतना बुरा है कि कास्ट की माँ भी अपनी बेटी को शो से बाहर खींच लेती है।	0
20 वीं सदी की फॉक्स की सड़क के किनारे 1948) न केवल एक मूर्खतापूर्ण नॉयर है, बल्कि एक फिल्म का एक अलग-थलग न किया हुआ बोर है।	0
असंबद्ध कार्डबोर्ड पात्रों से भरा यह एडवर्ड चोडोरोव द्वारा स्पष्ट रूप से लिखा गया है, जिन्होंने उत्पादन भी किया, और आश्चर्यजनक रूप से जीन नेग्युल्स्को द्वारा निर्देशित किया गया है, जिसमें से एक बहुत अधिक उम्मीद करेगा।	0
यहाँ से Widmark चरित्र पर अनजाने में हास्य हो जाता है!	0
कार्यवाही में इतनी जल्दी उनका मार्बल खो जाना पूरी तरह से असंभव और असम्बद्ध है।	0
और अगर यह आपके लिए एक फिल्म की गड़बड़ी के लिए पर्याप्त नहीं है - चित्र को स्टूडियो सेट और इनडोर एक्सटीरियर के निरंतर उपयोग के साथ भी जोड़ा जाता है।	0
इस तरह की डॉक्यूमेंट्री ने जो कुछ भी मेरे लिए प्रेरित किया वह मेरे से परे है!	0
(बहुत गंभीर स्पॉइलर) यह फिल्म एक बड़ी निराशा थी।	0
वहाँ बहुत सारी समस्याएं हैं जहाँ मुझे नहीं पता कि कहाँ से शुरू करें।	0
कलाकार महान थे।	1
स्टीव मार्विन एक मध्यम आयु वर्ग, उच्च वर्ग, सफेद आदमी के एक बहुत ही अजीब प्रदर्शन बचाता है।	1
बेट्टी सफेद और जीन स्मार्ट जोड़ें और आपके पास एक महान कलाकार है - सभी ने अपने हिस्सों को वास्तव में अच्छी तरह से खेला।	1
लेकिन फिल्म कई गंभीर गलतियां करती है।	0
सबसे पहले, सभी को रोकने के लिए पर्याप्त नस्लीय स्टीरियोटाइप और नस्लीय मजाक हैं।	0
फिल्म काले कलाकारों के सदस्यों के प्रति नस्लीय ढलानों से अटी पड़ी है और बदले में गोरों को मोरों और स्तन के रूप में दर्शाया गया है।	0
रेस कार्ड को एक तरफ रखकर, फिल्म में प्रमुख दोष को देखने देता है: वे लतीफा के चरित्र को नष्ट करते हैं।	0
कोई वास्तविक साजिश नहीं है।	0
मैं इस फिल्म को फिर से मुफ्त में नहीं देखूंगा।	0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE हमारे सिनेमा इतिहास के लिए एक आश्चर्यजनक रूप से महत्वपूर्ण फिल्म है।	1
मिकी माउस की यह दूसरी उपस्थिति (उस वर्ष के पहले मूक ग्रह क्रैजी के बाद) संभवतः उनकी सबसे प्रसिद्ध फिल्म है - ज्यादातर इसलिए कि यह इतनी जमीन-तोड़ थी।	1
जब तक आप मिकी को बोलते नहीं सुनते हैं, तब तक पूरी फिल्म में कई तरह के साउंड इफेक्ट्स और म्यूजिक होते हैं - कुछ ऐसा जो हम अभी हासिल कर लेते हैं, लेकिन जो 1928 में एक बड़ी भीड़ थी।	1
हालांकि, लगभग 25 वर्षों के बाद फिर से शॉर्ट देखने के बाद, मैं चकित था कि फिल्म वास्तव में कितनी कालातीत है।	1
यह सिर्फ आराध्य है जो मिकी को &quot;तुर्की में स्ट्रॉ&quot; में एक उच्च कल्पनाशील (यदि कभी-कभी क्रूर) तरीके से खेलते हुए देखता है।	1
चतुर और एक वास्तविक भीड़-आनंद - यह फिल्म अभी भी 80 अद्भुत वर्षों के बाद भी मिकी की सर्वश्रेष्ठ फिल्मों में शुमार है।	1
निर्दयी ठग की द्विध्रुवीयता (एक मिनट एक निर्दयी हत्यारा, अगले मिनट एक लव का डायपर वाणिज्यिक) पूरी तरह से असंबद्ध है।	0
मैं बहुत निराश हूं कि इस फिल्म को बहुत सारे पुरस्कार और प्रशंसाएं मिलेंगी, खासकर तब जब फिल्म के अधिक योग्य काम वहां से हों।	0

मुझे नहीं लगता कि इस रीमेक में कोई रिडीम करने वाले गुण हैं।	0
यह एकमात्र खराब फिल्म हो सकती है जिसे उन्होंने कभी बनाया था।	0
इतना बुरा ... अच्छा ... यह सिर्फ बुरा है।	0
यह फिल्म एक बुरे कथानक का एक ठोस उदाहरण है और एक बहुत ही बुरा विचार है।	0
थॉमरसन और जेम्स जैसे अच्छे अभिनेताओं को इस तरह से गड़बड़ करते हुए देखना एक शर्म की बात है।	0
मुझे लगा कि यह बुरा है।	0
दोनों फिल्में बहुत ही भयानक हैं, लेकिन 1986 के संस्करण के श्रेय के लिए यह बहुत ही कम था।	0
आइए सभी समस्याओं से शुरू करते हैं - अभिनय, विशेष रूप से मुख्य प्रोफेसर से, बहुत खराब था।	0
स्क्रिप्ट बड़ी त्रुटिपूर्ण गड़बड़ है।	0
लेखन कितना गूंगा है इसका सबसे अच्छा उदाहरण जब यह स्थापित हो जाता है कि आप उल्कापिंड के एक टुकड़े से एक हार को हटाकर ज़ोंबी-छात्रों को वापस मनुष्यों में बदल सकते हैं।	0

दृश्य प्रभाव AWFUL थे।	0
अंतरिक्ष में सीजी खोलने का क्रम ऐसा लग रहा था कि इसे भगवान के लिए Microsoft स्लाइड शो पर बनाया जा सकता है!	0
अंत में गैस टैंकों का &quot;विस्फोट&quot; उतना ही भयानक था।	0
ठीक है, मैं अपने आप को एक निष्पक्ष आलोचक मानना चाहता हूं, इसलिए मैं क्रेडिट देता हूं जहां क्रेडिट की देयता है - जीव प्रभाव वास्तव में बहुत अच्छा था।	1
गोटी को घिनौना, डोलिंग वाले दांतों से प्यार होता है!	1
फिल्म को सारांशित करने के लिए, &quot;ब्रीडर्स&quot; एक भयानक, सस्ते में बनाई गई डरावनी फिल्म है जिसे इबोला वायरस की तरह बचा जाना चाहिए।	0
सिफारिश नहीं की गई।	0
वह स्क्रीन पर देखने के लिए लगभग असहनीय है, उसके पास कोई करिश्मा नहीं है, और भयानक कॉमेडिक टाइमिंग है।	0
इसके अलावा यह भयानक नेतृत्व है, इस फिल्म में अन्य विवादों का भार है।	0
मैं समझता हूं कि यह एक सस्ती पॉपकॉर्न कॉमेडी है, लेकिन इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि इसे हमारी बुद्धिमत्ता का पूरी तरह से अपमान करना है, और इतना अविश्वसनीय रूप से हैक किया गया है कि यह अपमानजनक है।	0
लुईस ब्लैक की काफी प्रतिभा यहां भी बर्बाद हो जाती है, क्योंकि जब वह अनियंत्रित होता है, तो वह अपनी सबसे अधिक व्यस्तता में होता है, जिसे पीजी -13 रेटिंग निश्चित रूप से अनुमति नहीं देगा।	0
फिल्म का एकमात्र उज्ज्वल स्थान जोनाह हिल था (जो अंतरिम में खोए हुए वजन की मात्रा के कारण हाल ही में सुपरटाड के प्रशंसकों के लिए लगभग अपरिचित लगेगा)।	1
अब खर्च की गई पहली फिल्म की मौलिकता और ताजगी के साथ, इस रीमेक की पेशकश कम ही थी।	0
बजट जाहिर तौर पर बहुत सीमित था।	0
यह न केवल कलाकारों में, बल्कि नीचे-बराबर स्क्रिप्ट में भी परिलक्षित होता था, जो पहले के क्लासिक से बहुत अधिक उधार लेता था।	0
हालाँकि, यहाँ चीजों को संतुलित करने के लिए कोई अच्छा अभिनय, एक्शन या लोकेशन का काम नहीं था।	0
फिल्मांकन का विस्तार कम था।	0
यह उन परिदृश्यों के व्यापक स्वीप को व्यक्त करने में विफल रहा जो मूल का एक बड़ा हिस्सा थे।	0
आम तौर पर; इसमें सिर्फ कल्पना की कमी थी।	0

मैं विश्वास नहीं कर सकता कि यह भी एक अगली कड़ी है!	0
जो ठीक है, मैं इसे इतनी बुरी समीक्षा क्यों दे रहा हूं!	0
90 के दशक के बच्चे होने के नाते, मैंने वास्तव में इस शो का आनंद लिया और मैं गर्व के साथ कह सकता हूं कि मैंने इसे बड़े समय और यहां तक कि शास्त्रीय डब्ल्यूडब्ल्यूआई कार्टून से भी अधिक आनंद लिया।	1
लेकिन &quot;टाइनी टूनस&quot; ने 90 के दशक को बनाए रखा और अब तक बनाए गए सबसे लोकप्रिय, मज़ेदार और अंडररेटेड कार्टूनों में से एक को वितरित किया।	1
यादें मुरीद हैं लेकिन मैं केवल इतना कह सकता हूं कि मुझे शो से जुड़े हर एक एपिसोड और प्रोडक्ट में मजा आया।	1
आसानी से, किसी भी अन्य कार्टून ने मुझे एक निविदा तरीके से हंसी नहीं बनाया (किशोर के लिए अंधेरे सिटकॉम उन्मुख होने से पहले)।	1
सभी पात्र मजाकिया थे और उनमें सच्चा लीड किरदार न होने की ख़ासियत थी।	1
हर एक पात्र प्रफुल्लित था और एक पात्र कहलाता था।	1
इस कहानी का हर तत्व शीर्ष पर था, अत्यधिक रूप से तीखी और विरोधाभास था कि इसके माध्यम से बैठना दर्दनाक था।	0
उसे लगता है कि पंद्रह साल की उम्र में रेखा गलत हो गई थी, हालांकि वे ओह की कोशिश कर रहे हैं, इसलिए यह कहना मुश्किल है कि पंद्रह साल की उम्र वास्तव में कैसी होगी, उम, आप जानते हैं, अच्छी तरह से ... बात करते हैं।	0
पेराबो में एक अच्छा ऊर्जा स्तर है और यह स्पष्ट रूप से एक कैमरे के सामने बहुत आरामदायक है।	1
इस खराब काम के लिए बस कोई बहाना नहीं है।	0
मैंने यह फिल्म देखी और मुझे लगा कि यह एक बेवकूफ फिल्म है।	0
यह और भी अधिक मूर्खतापूर्ण है कि किसने सोचा था कि लॉस एंजिल्स में एक ज्वालामुखी होना चाहिए?	0
आपके साथ ईमानदार होना, यह अविश्वसनीय बकवास है और बहुत ही मूर्खतापूर्ण है।	0
अंत में, मैं इस फिल्म से परेशान नहीं होऊंगा क्योंकि लॉस एंजिल्स में एक ज्वालामुखी बकवास के अलावा कुछ नहीं है।	0
कहानी लाइन सिर्फ भयानक है!	0
यह सिर्फ दर्दनाक है!	0
और लहजे बिल्कुल लाजिमी हैं!	0
मुझे उल्टी करने के लिए इस फिल्म में पर्याप्त पाखंड भी है।	0
इस बकवास फिल्म को देखने में अपना समय बर्बाद न करें।	0
मेरा मानना है कि पिच ब्लैक ने अच्छा किया था।	1
किरदार दिलचस्प हैं और आप उनके बारे में और जानना चाहते हैं कि फिल्म जितनी लंबी चलेगी, और मुझे लगता है कि लोग आश्चर्यचकित होंगे कि कौन इसे बनाता है और क्या नहीं।	1
जाओ इसे देखो!	1
यह देख ओमित।	0
बहुत अजीब बात है!	1
मेरी रेटिंग: 10 में से सिर्फ 3।	0
पात्र दिलचस्प हैं और आप वास्तव में उनकी परवाह करते हैं।	1
अंत के क्रेडिट के दौरान एक शानदार साउंडट्रैक और एक आकर्षक गीत के साथ एक त्वरित क्लासिक।	1
इसे याद मत करो।	1
यह फिल्म बनाने का एक बेहतरीन नमूना है, जिसमें कई थीमों के साथ इस मौसा पर उबाल और कभी-कभी उबलते हुए और कवि के बोहेमियन, आत्म-भोगपूर्ण वर्षों के सभी अध्ययन शामिल हैं जो लंदन के हवाई बमबारी और एक वेल्श तटीय पीछे हटने की बाहरी शांति का अनुभव करते हैं। - दोस्ती, वासना और प्यार, कला और अनुभव बनाम व्यावहारिक चिंताओं, ईर्ष्या, प्रतिद्वंद्विता, कायरता और अहंकार बनाम वीरता और आत्म-बलिदान और अधिक के बीच सीमा।	1
एक परिपक्व, सूक्ष्म लिपि, जो कभी-कभी नाटकीय रूप से ध्यान केंद्रित करने का सुझाव देती है और अंतर्निहित तनावों को अच्छी तरह से परिपूर्ण प्रदर्शनों के द्वारा परोसा जाता है (इसके अलावा अजीब अनुचित मुस्कुराते हुए कहा जाता है कि केइरा नाइटली के लिए प्रवण है, हालांकि शायद इस समय दिशा के तहत अन्य पात्रों ने खुद इसका उल्लेख किया है। )।	1
लेकिन प्रत्येक क्षण के सभी अति सुंदर दृश्य रचना के ऊपर, प्वाइंटलिस्टिक अशुद्ध होम मूवी फुटेज सहित क्लोज-अप, कैमरा एंगल और लाइटिंग के आविष्कारशील और सुरुचिपूर्ण उपयोग के साथ निहारना एक आश्चर्य और खुशी है।	1
यह एक बर्तोलुची के रूप में देखने में लगातार सुंदर है, लेकिन यहाँ के रिश्ते अधिक दृढ़ हैं और उस मास्टर के कुछ कामों की तुलना में कथा अधिक आकर्षक है।	1
मूल आधार बर्बाद हो गया है क्योंकि यह दस्तावेजी चालक दल पर अकथनीय फोकस द्वारा दरकिनार कर दिया गया है।	0
बावजूद, फिल्म ज्यादातर स्तरों पर विफल रहती है।	0
हर कीमत पर बचें।	0
मैंने इस फिल्म को क्रिसमस पर देखा, और यह कितनी बेहतरीन फिल्म थी!	1
मुझे लगा कि एरोल फ्लिन क्रस्ट के रूप में शानदार था और तब से मेरा पसंदीदा अभिनेता बन गया है!	1
ओलिविया डी हैविलैंड के साथ उनका अभिनय शानदार था और अंत शानदार था!	1
मैं हमेशा से जानता था कि एरोल फ्लिन एक शानदार अभिनेता थे क्योंकि वह मेरे प्रिय पसंदीदा अभिनेता थे, और मैं एक बच्चे के रूप में उनकी फिल्में देखते हुए बड़ा हुआ हूं।	1
लेकिन यह तब तक नहीं था जब तक मैंने यह फिल्म नहीं देखी थी कि मुझे एहसास हुआ कि वह वास्तव में कितना महान था।	1
मैं इस फिल्म को 10 में से 10 दूंगा!	1
मुझे पता है कि जिम ओ&#39;कॉनर बहुत ऊर्जावान थे और उनके जैसा कोई नहीं हो सकता था, लेकिन जॉर्ज अच्छी तरह सुस्त थे।	0
वह वास्तव में मेजबानी करना नहीं चाहता था; उनके आवाज-ओवर नीरस थे, मेहमानों के साथ शामिल नहीं थे।	0
हिचकॉक से लवली थोड़ा थ्रिलर, एक हत्या के जासूस, एक अपहृत बच्चा, एक बुरा चर्च, एक विदेशी भूखंड और कुछ यादृच्छिक करदाताओं से घिरे हुए बहुत सारे अच्छे शीनिगान के साथ।	1
जिमी स्टीवर्ट हिचकॉक के लिए एक महान नायक के रूप में है, कहानी एक दूतावास समारोह में अपने शांत चरमोत्कर्ष के साथ परिपक्व होती है, लेकिन इसमें हिचकॉक के काले और सफेद, कम बजट मूल के ब्रूडिंग मेनस का अभाव है।	1
फिर भी महान गुरु की स्थिर से एक और अद्भुत फिल्म।	1
मेरा कहना है कि यह फिल्म एक उत्कृष्ट विज्ञान फाई फिल्म के रूप में उत्कृष्ट रूप से निर्मित और रेटिंग में सबसे ऊपर है!	1
उत्कृष्ट रूप से विज्ञान-फाई के सर्वश्रेष्ठ उत्पादकों में से एक स्कॉट वैंडिवर द्वारा निर्मित!	1
लेकिन यह मनोरंजक है, फिर भी।	1
यह एक तरह की फिल्म है जिसे देखना एक खुशी की बात है।	1
फिल्म में मुश्किल से एक उबाऊ पल है और हास्य के बहुत सारे हिस्से हैं।	1
कलाकार हमेशा की तरह मनोरंजक है।	1
कुल मिलाकर, एक खुशी!	1
यह फिल्म इतनी मन-मुग्ध कर देने वाली है, इसे बनाया भी नहीं जा सकता था।	0
फिल्म में किसी भी वास्तविक डर या तनाव का अभाव है और चिकित्सा शब्दावली में से कुछ का इस्तेमाल किया गया है, अगर यह कम से कम कहने के लिए थोड़ा iffy है और मैं खुद को इंसुलिन पर निर्भर मधुमेह के रूप में कहता हूं।	0
अभिनय के बारे में कम से कम बेहतर कहा जाता है।	0
यह फिल्म कार्य की जटिलता और दक्षिण अफ्रीका के सामने अविश्वसनीय चुनौतियों का खुलासा करने का एक उत्कृष्ट काम करती है।	1
मेरा मानना है कि हर एक को इस फिल्म को देखना चाहिए क्योंकि मुझे लगता है कि दक्षिण अफ्रीका के बाहर के कुछ लोग इसके अतीत को समझते हैं और सत्य और सुलह प्रक्रिया में क्या किया जा रहा है।	1
इस फिल्म में शानदार फोटोग्राफी / सिनेमैटोग्राफी से कम नहीं है।	1
अभिनय शानदार है, कहानियों को एक साथ बुना जाता है, और कुत्ते शानदार होते हैं ............. एक किराया, देखना या देखना चाहिए।	1
सबटाइटल से डरें नहीं ........ इसकी कीमत थोड़ी कम है	1
उत्कृष्ट कार्य - निष्पादन।	1
अभी भी आसपास अच्छे अभिनेता हैं!	1
साथ ही शानदार निर्देशन और फोटोग्राफी।	1
शेक्सपियर के लिए बहुत सही है, और सभी शेक्सपियर प्रशंसकों के लिए एक &#39;अवश्य&#39; है।	1
मैकबेथ (जेसन कॉनरी) ने मुझे अपने अंतिम मोनोलॉग (संक्षिप्त कैंडल, आउट) के साथ आँसू में स्थानांतरित कर दिया। उन्होंने नैतिक क्षय और अंधेरे को एक मानवीय चेहरा बना दिया, जो इसे और अधिक दिलचस्प बनाता है।	1
हेलेन बैक्सेंडेल एक बहुत ही विश्वसनीय महिला मैकबेथ है जो कई बार बहुत खुशमिजाज हो सकती है और कभी-कभी वह एक शरारती लड़की की तरह दिखती है, लेकिन खून और बुराई के लिए उसके स्वाद में घातक है।	1
यदि आप मृत्यु और क्षय को प्यार करते हैं, और शेक्सपियर के बोल ... यह एक है।	1
यह डॉ। सेस पुस्तक का एक मजाकिया और रमणीय अनुकूलन है, जो यूपीए के बेहतरीन और पूरी तरह से अकादमी पुरस्कार के योग्य है।	1
विशेष उल्लेख शानदार संगीत स्कोर और ध्वनि प्रभावों से बना होना चाहिए, जो इस तरह के एक यादगार और सुखद कार्टून बनाने में मदद करने में एक अभिन्न तत्व हैं।	1
हालाँकि पॉल श्रेडर ने वास्तव में &quot;मिशिमा&quot; के बारे में एक फिल्म बनाई है जो शानदार और जटिल दोनों है।	1
यह भी उल्लेखनीय है कि जॉन बेली की बेहतरीन कुरकुरी खूबसूरती से रंगीन छायांकन और ईको इशिओका द्वारा शानदार प्रोडक्शन डिजाइन और वेशभूषा है, जो कोपोला की ड्रैकुला के लिए यादगार वेशभूषा के लिए गए, जिसके लिए उन्हें एक अच्छा ऑस्कर मिला।	1
यहां तक कि समय (1971) और प्रारूप (कुछ प्रकार की मिनी-श्रृंखला) के लिए खराब उत्पादन मूल्यों की अनुमति, यह बायाद है।	0
जब तक आप ऑस्टिन के काम की सभी मौजूदा फिल्मों को &quot;कलेक्ट&quot; नहीं कर सकते, तब तक आप इसे छोड़ सकते हैं।	0
यदि आप इसे देखते हैं, हालांकि, छोटी सांत्वनाएं हैं: ऐनी की बहन की भूमिका निभाने वाली अभिनेत्रियां प्रत्येक अपनी भूमिकाओं के साथ एक अद्भुत काम करती हैं।	1

यह एक आश्चर्यजनक फिल्म है।	1
कच्ची और सूक्ष्म रूप से चलती है।	1
यह एक बहुत ही मनोरंजक, बुद्धिमान मंच नाटक की तरह महसूस किया (लेकिन बिना नाटकीय नाटकीय भावना के वास्तव में एक मंच पर लोगों को देखने से प्राप्त होता है) जो हर किसी के सफेद झूठ के आतंक पर राक्षसी परिणामों के लिए खेलते हैं।	1
सभी मुख्य खिलाड़ी मंत्रमुग्ध हैं।	1

कई निरंतरता त्रुटियां हैं: एक अन्य उपयोगकर्ता ने गैरेज में अलग-अलग कारों पर टिप्पणी की, जो का चश्मा ... जो मुझे सबसे अधिक मिला, वह यह तथ्य था कि जो के चेहरे के बाल विन्यास दृश्य से दृश्य में बदलते हैं।	0
यह सिर्फ एक बेहतरीन फिल्म है।	1
10 में से 10 सितारे।	1

सजा पार्क सिनेमा का एक शानदार नमूना है।	1
दक्षिणी कैलिफोर्निया के रेगिस्तान में अपने पेटेंट फॉक्स डॉक्यूमेंट्री शैली का उपयोग करते हुए, वॉटकिंस कोई अन्य फिल्म नहीं बनाते हैं।	1

मैं आपको इसके लिए बाहर देखने की सलाह देता हूं।	1
आप इसे पछतावा नहीं होगा!	1

इसमें बहुत अच्छा प्लॉट है, यह आपका पूरा ध्यान रखता है, अभिनय शानदार है, टॉम विल्किंसन शानदार था और एमिली वॉटसन भी बहुत अच्छी थी।	1
एक बहुत अच्छी फिल्म वास्तव में, महान और बिना शर्त प्यार के बारे में।	1
टॉम विल्किंसन का किरदार एक ऐसा व्यक्ति है जो उस प्रक्रिया के लिए तैयार नहीं है जो शुरू होने वाली है, लेकिन कहानी आगे बढ़ने पर वह इस मामले को हाथ में लेता है, और यह महान अभिनेता एक प्रदर्शन देता है जो आपको चरित्र की पीड़ा और पीड़ा का एहसास कराता है।	1
एमिली वॉटसन का चरित्र बहुत मजबूत है, और उसे केवल एक त्वरित नज़र देना है और आप सब कुछ समझते हैं।	1
समीक्षकों के ढेर के बावजूद, मुझे यह फिल्म पसंद आई।	1
वास्तव में, मुझे यह इंटरव्यू विथ अ वैम्पायर की तुलना में बेहतर लगा और मुझे यह लेसेट (स्टुअर्ट टाउनसेंड) क्रूज़ के प्रयास से बेहतर लगा।	1
अइलियाह अकाशा के रूप में बहुत अच्छा था, सम्मोहक स्थानों में (उसका पहला प्रवेश द्वार और मिनी नृत्य दृश्य)।	1
मैं ऐनी राइस की शैली, संवेदनशीलता और उपचार के कारण इस श्रृंखला का बहुत बड़ा प्रशंसक हूं।	1
मुझे लगता है कि मुझे उसकी शिथिलता का विवरण पसंद है - वह विश्वसनीय था।	1
अंत में फुटबॉल के दृश्य हैरान करने वाले थे।	0
लेकिन मुझे लगा कि उनका अभिनय कुशल था।	1
मेरेडिथ एम सब से बेहतर था।	1
अद्भुत भावना और दिल के साथ एक बहुत ही आकर्षक फिल्म।	1
ऐसा बहुत कम होता है जब कोई फिल्म निर्माता देखभाल और प्यार के साथ एक योग्य नैतिक कहानी बताने के लिए समय लेता है जो अत्यधिक सिरप या भोग में होने के जाल में नहीं पड़ता है।	1
वास्तव में प्यारी फिल्म के लिए दस में से नौ।	1
भविष्य की गोरमिस्टर लुसियो फुलसी की यह शुरुआती फिल्म, जिआलो उप-शैली के लिए एक बहुत अच्छा जोड़ है।	1
यह शुरुआती 70 के दशक के सर्वश्रेष्ठ इतालवी थ्रिलर में से एक है।	1
एक स्टैंडआउट दृश्य।	1
यह दृश्य बहुत मजबूत और अप्रिय है।	0
तकनीकी रूप से, फिल्म प्रभावशाली कैमरा-वर्क, ठोस अभिनय और रिज़ ऑर्टोलानी के प्रभावी संगीत के साथ अच्छी तरह से बनाई गई है - विशेष रूप से अच्छा एक आवर्ती बेहोश महिला मुखर है जो लगता है कि यह एक दूर की पहाड़ी से आ रहा है।	1
यह अभी भी जंगली सामान है और जियालो सिनेमा के प्रशंसकों के लिए अत्यधिक अनुशंसित है।	1
फिल्म शुरू से अंत तक बहुत दिलचस्प थी।	1
मुझे जिस तरह से डस्टिन हॉफमैन का चरित्र अपने बेटे के साथ रहने के लिए सब कुछ करने के लिए तैयार था, वह पसंद आया।	1
यह फिल्म भी खुलासा कर रही है।	1
व्यक्तिगत रूप से, मुझे लगता है कि यह दर्शाता है कि लोगों को अन्य लोगों को इस मुद्दे में शामिल किए बिना एक समझौता खोजने के लिए सीखना चाहिए।	1
और यह उबाऊ था।	0
मैं क्लिचेज़ से इतना थक गया हूं कि सिर्फ आलसी लेखन है, और यहां वे मोटे और तेज में आते हैं।	0
पीएस फिल्म का एकमात्र दृश्य शांत था, जब केंद्रीय चरित्र पाता है कि उसके कमरे को उड़ा दिया गया है।	1
यह एक ताजा, सूक्ष्म और बल्कि उदात्त प्रभाव है।	1
एक इतालवी समीक्षक ने इसे &quot;एक छोटी, महान फिल्म&quot; कहा, और यह सही है।	1
सभी कलाकार एक अद्भुत प्रदर्शन देते हैं, विशेष रूप से जेनिफर रूबिन को जेमी हैरिस के रूप में, जो शुरुआत में नर्वस स्टारलेट से बदल जाती है, अजीब घटनाओं के माध्यम से वह शांत स्टार का हिस्सा है।	1
आप इस फिल्म में लोगों की वास्तविक भावनाओं के बारे में बहुत कुछ सीखते हैं, और फिल्म व्यवसाय के बारे में भी बहुत कुछ सीखते हैं।	1
शुरुआत में फिल्म की स्थितियों में फिल्म और &quot;अभिनय कोच&quot; द्वारा उसके साथ खेले जाने वाले खेल के माध्यम से आकर्षक हैं।	1
इसके अलावा मार्क स्नो द्वारा संगीत संभवतः सबसे अच्छा स्कोर है जिसे मैंने कभी सुना है।	1

मैंने इसे 1973 में टीवी पर एक बच्चे के रूप में देखा, जब यह &quot;द स्ट्रेंजर&quot; था और मुझे यह पसंद आया।	1
लेकिन फिल्म की शुरुआत में अंतरिक्ष यात्री और उनके डॉक्टर के बीच की जोड़ी एक सही मुद्रा है, अगर कोई मानता है कि यह फिल्म शीत युद्ध में अच्छी तरह से बनी थी और अंतरिक्ष यात्री का सबसे बड़ा डर है कि वह यूएसएसआर में दुर्घटनाग्रस्त हो गया है।	1
यह फिल्म तो कमाल की है!	1
मैं इसे प्यार करता था, यह वास्तव में डरावना था।	1
मुझे चीख फिल्में और सभी डरावनी फिल्में पसंद हैं और यह एक तरह से रैंक करता है।	1
यदि आप एक असली डराना चाहते हैं यह किराया!	1
10/10	1
यह एक असाधारण फिल्म है।	1
एक कोर्टरूम ड्रामा के रूप में, यह सम्मोहक है, अमेरिकी न्याय प्रणाली पर अभियोग के रूप में, यह भयावह है।	1
यह फिल्म कानूनी प्रक्रिया की बुनियादी खामियों को उजागर करती है, कि यह अपराध या निर्दोषता की खोज के बारे में नहीं है, बल्कि यह है कि अदालत में कौन बेहतर पेश करता है।	1
फिल्म अच्छी तरह से समझी गई है, समझी गई है और मैंने देखा है सबसे अच्छे कोर्ट रूम वृत्तचित्रों में से एक।	1
यह ज्यादातर रुटीन फैक्ट-बेस्ड टीवी ड्रामा को कोल के उम्दा प्रदर्शन से बढ़ावा मिलता है।	1
प्रेडिक्टेबल, लेकिन बुरी घड़ी नहीं।	1
यह स्पष्ट था कि उसके पास इस हिस्से को खींचने की क्षमता और क्षमता थी।	1
वह फिल्म को अच्छी तरह से करती है।	1
कॉन्स्टेंटाइन सब कुछ सही तीव्रता देता है और लगता है कि अंतर्निहित मनोवैज्ञानिक प्रेरणाओं की अच्छी समझ है।	1
यह देखने के लिए अद्भुत और प्रेरणादायक है, और मुझे आशा है कि यह वीडियो या डीवीडी पर फिर से जारी किया जाएगा।	1
कचरा का यह टुकड़ा कैसे जारी किया गया था यह मेरे से परे है: अभिनय, कहानी, चरित्र, कथित विशेष प्रभाव, आदि ... सभी गलत हैं।	0
वास्तव में, यह बदबू एक प्रत्यक्ष-टू-वीडियो रिलीज की तरह बदबू आ रही है।	0
हर कीमत पर बचें!	0
स्टार ट्रेक V अंतिम फ्रंटियर श्रृंखला में सबसे खराब है।	0
इसमें शामिल अभिनय सभी में शामिल है, जिसमें शटनर और निमोय जैसे लोग शामिल हैं, जो खराब और धुले हुए हैं और उन्हें वास्तविक जीवन में जितने पुराने लगते हैं, विशेष प्रभाव से निपटने के लिए जब स्पॉक को एक जेट पैक पर किर्क को गिरना पड़ता है एक पहाड़ से नीचे।	0
हास्य पर प्रयास दयनीय थे और कहानी इतनी भयानक है कि यह सोचकर सहन नहीं होता है जिसमें मूल रूप से एक वालकैन शामिल है जो भगवान को खोजने के लिए उद्यम चोरी करता है (गंभीरता से) मैं सिर्फ इस फिल्म के बारे में कोई परवाह नहीं करता था और ओह उहुरा का उल्लेख नहीं करता है एक पेट नृत्य पुरुष रक्षकों को विचलित करने के लिए।	0
इस फिल्म के लिए एकमात्र जगह कचरा है।	0
श्रृंखला की सबसे खराब स्थिति।	0
संपादन: इस फिल्म का संपादन मेरी राय में अभूतपूर्व था।	1
जब कोई गीत विषयों की भावनाओं को बेहतर ढंग से समझा सकता था, जैसे कि जब जे एडम्स का दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण जीवन चर्चा का विषय था, तो नील यंग द्वारा ओल्ड मैन गीत बजाया गया था, जो कई भावनाओं को उद्घाटित करता है।	1
सिनेमैटोग्राफी: फिल्म को दिलचस्प तरीके से शूट किया गया था।	1
बेशक 70 के दशक का फुटेज दानेदार था, लेकिन इसने ही फिल्म को बढ़ाया।	1
यह फिल्म कई प्रसन्नता और आश्चर्य प्रदान करती है।	1
जब एकिल और फिलिप ने खूबसूरती से &quot;डॉन जियोवानी&quot; से एक युगल गीत गाया जो फिल्म में उनकी स्थिति का पूरी तरह से वर्णन करता है, तो आप इस उत्कृष्ट फिल्म की सूक्ष्म परतों की सराहना करते हैं।	1
कहानी 18 वीं सदी के जूटलैंड में सामने आई है और पीरियड इंस्ट्रूमेंट्स पर बजने वाले पीरियड म्यूजिक का इस्तेमाल सिर्फ एक और बेहतरीन टच है।	1
आप कैल्स एन सरकोफेगे के अपने हिस्से में जनरल लोवेनहिल्म के उत्तम आनंद को साझा करते हैं, भले ही आप सिर्फ एक फिल्म देख रहे हों - लेकिन आप स्वाद लेने के लिए सिर्फ एक छोटे नमूने की कामना करते हैं।	1
लेकिन यह समझने वाली फिल्म स्थायी छाप छोड़ती है।	1
यह जो गर्मी उत्पन्न करता है, वह इसकी पिछली पृष्ठभूमि के विपरीत होता है।	1
आप थियेटर से बाहर जाकर सितारों के नीचे नृत्य करना चाहते हैं।	1
जैसा कि आप इस कलाकार से उम्मीद करेंगे, वह शीर्ष पायदान पर है।	1
पात्रों को आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अच्छी तरह से चित्रित किया जाता है, विशेष रूप से ग्रिम्स और ब्लेक, और सभी अभिनेताओं ने संवाद को प्रफुल्लित और यथार्थवादी बनाने के लिए गाल में डेडपैन जीभ की सही मात्रा के साथ अपनी तेज पटकथा लिखी है।	1
एंगस स्क्रिम्म भी कुछ हद तक संक्षिप्त लेकिन यादगार भूमिका में एक अच्छे प्रदर्शन में बदल जाता है, धीरे-धीरे मेनसिनिंग, वायलिन बजाते एनाटोमिस्ट डॉक्टर क्विन।	1
निष्कर्ष - मुझे अच्छा लगा।	1
यह एक लंबा समय है जब मुझे एक फिल्म द्वारा इतना मनोरंजन किया गया था।	1
मैं इसके बारे में कुछ भी बुरा कहने के लिए संघर्ष करता हूं।	1
मेरे शब्दों को चिन्हित करें, यह उन पंथ फिल्मों में से एक है, जैसे ईविल डेड 2 या फैंटम, जिसे लोग अभी भी खोज रहे हैं और 20, 30, 40 साल की रेखा से प्यार कर रहे हैं।	1
यह बहुत आश्चर्यजनक है कि यह अद्भुत फिल्म 1949 में बनी थी, क्योंकि हॉलीवुड में आम तौर पर उस समय काले और सफेद मुद्दों से संबंधित रेत में अपने सामूहिक सिर थे।	1
यह फिल्म इस स्टैंड को लेने के लिए मजबूत कुडोस की हकदार है, अपने ज्यादातर कम-ज्ञात कलाकारों से असाधारण अभिनय करने के लिए और सुपर-बुद्धिमान स्क्रिप्ट के लिए जो दर्शकों का अपमान नहीं करती है या सफेद नस्लवाद की बात आती है।	1
इसके अलावा, फिल्म के बजाय मामूली बजट और तेजी से चलने के समय के साथ, यह एक अद्भुत काम करता है!	1
जुआनो हर्नान्डेज़ (एक असाधारण अभिनेता जो उस समय की कई फिल्मों में सहायक भूमिकाएँ निभाते थे) एक घमंडी अश्वेत व्यक्ति है जिस पर दक्षिण में एक गोरे व्यक्ति की हत्या का आरोप है।	1
I LOVE LUCY पर ट्रंबल)।	1
यदि आपके पास मौका है तो इसे अपने बच्चों के साथ देखें - यह पिछले 50 वर्षों में कितनी दूर की दौड़ के रिश्ते आए हैं, इसके बारे में कुछ आश्चर्यजनक संवाद खोलेंगे।	1
अगर आप कर सकते हैं दोनों फिल्में देखें।	1
हालांकि, यह उस वर्ष था, जिसने हमें याद दिलाया कि हस्टन अभी भी अपने खेल के शीर्ष पर था जैसा कि जेम्स जॉयस के प्रशंसित उपन्यास &quot;द डेड&quot; के उनके वफादार अनुकूलन द्वारा विकसित किया गया था।	1
भावनाएँ, विचार ... नृत्य के दौरान गेब्रियल की बेचैनी ... ये सभी अंतरंग जीवन में छलांग लगाते हैं और हस्टन के चित्रण में दर्शकों की समझ के भीतर आते हैं।	1
बहुत निराश और आश्चर्य है कि यह ऑस्कर शॉर्टलिस्ट में कैसे हो सकता है।	0
यह बहुत धीमा है।	0
भूखंड में छेद के बहुत सारे: वहाँ कुछ भी नहीं है कि वह सम्राट कैसे बने; वह बचपन और परिपक्व उम्र के बीच 20 साल कहाँ बिताता है, इसके बारे में कुछ नहीं।	0

एंड ऑफ डेज़ सबसे बड़ी बिग-बजट एक्शन फिल्मों में से एक है जिसे मैंने कभी देखा है।	0
वह निश्चित रूप से नहीं जानता कि वायु सेना एक के पटकथा लेखक से एक सुसंगत एक्शन फिल्म कैसे बनाई जाए जो केवल एक बड़ी राशि के लिए स्क्रिप्ट लिखने के लिए बाध्य थी।	0
यह उन सबसे खराब फिल्मों में से एक थी जिन्हें मैंने कभी देखा है।	0
मैं अभी भी कोशिश कर रहा हूं कि यह कितना बुरा था।	0
यह फिल्म संभवतः हॉरर के सबसे रचनात्मक कार्यों में से एक है।	1
इसमें वह सब कुछ है जो आप चाहते हैं ... सस्पेंस, ड्रामा, कॉमेडी, कन्फ्यूज़िंग सबप्लॉट्स, देशी अमरिकंस, ब्रेन ईटिंग ... अगर आप सभी की तलाश में रहते हैं, अंत में सभी दिमाग की फिल्में देख रहे हैं, तो आगे मत देखो।	1
&quot;महान ध्वनि प्रभाव, और प्रभावशाली विशेष प्रभावों के साथ, मैं इस फिल्म को पर्याप्त रूप से सुझा नहीं सकता।	1
मुझे अखरोट कहो, लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि यह अब तक की सर्वश्रेष्ठ फिल्मों में से एक है।	1
महान चरित्र अभिनेता Telly Savalas और पीटर बॉयल।	1
1 घंटा 54 मिनट का सरासर टेडियम, मेलोड्रामा और भयानक अभिनय, एक स्क्रिप्ट की गड़बड़ी, और अच्छे भगवान की एक डूबती हुई भावना, वे क्या कर रहे थे?	0
स्क्रिप्ट में बहुत सारे छेद।	0
यह दो घंटे की टीवी फिल्म की तरह है।	0
अब कल्पना कीजिए कि उन फैसलों में से हर एक को गलत बनाया गया था।	0
संवाद अमानवीय है।	0
अभिनय रसातल से परे है।	0
सब कुछ बदबू मारता है।	0
परेशानी यह है कि लेखन और निर्देशन से उन चीजों को स्थापित करना असंभव हो जाता है जो फिल्म को चरित्रहीन बनाते हैं, जैसे चरित्र, कहानी, विषय और इतने पर।	0
इससे भी बदतर, वहाँ एक अविश्वसनीय रूप से कमजोर उप-कथानक है जो बाद के दिनों के मैनसोनाइट्स के एक छोटे से बैंड का अनुसरण करता है क्योंकि वे एक रिपोर्टर के बाद जाते हैं जो हत्याओं की सालगिरह पर एक कहानी पर काम कर रहे हैं।	0
यह गूंगा और व्यर्थ है, और समय की पूरी बर्बादी है।	0
संक्षेप में, इस फिल्म से परेशान न हों।	0
मैं इसे खराब नहीं करूंगा, लेकिन बहुत आश्चर्यजनक तरीके से समाप्त होगा।	1
फिल्म का सबसे अच्छा दृश्य अंत में है, लेकिन मैं इसे खराब नहीं करूंगा।	1
अगर कभी एक लेखक और एक निर्देशक की दो उच्च अस्थिर स्वभावों को रचनात्मकता के निर्बाध संघ में पिघलने की क्षमता का संकेत था, तो यह है!	1
परिणाम एक बिजलीघर की उपलब्धि है, जो अब हमारी संस्कृति के सेलिब्रिटी के साथ परेशान मोह के कारण और अधिक सामयिक है, और यह प्रसिद्धि की विकृत व्याख्या है।	1
एक फिल्म आसानी से नहीं भूली।	1
लेकिन, केविन स्पेसी बडी एकरमैन के रूप में एक उत्कृष्ट, मौखिक सुनामी है - और पूरी तरह से विश्वसनीय है क्योंकि वह एक महान अभिनेता है।	1
हाल के वर्षों में किसी भी फिल्म की सूक्ष्म कॉमेडी की पटकथा बेजोड़ है।	1
किरदार दिलचस्प हैं, भले ही थोड़ा सा पूर्वानुमान हो।	1
सभी उम्र के लिए अत्यधिक अनुशंसित है, हालांकि युवा सेट शायद कुछ अधिक सूक्ष्म संदर्भों की सराहना नहीं करेंगे, वे निश्चित रूप से विशेष रूप से एक गैली दृश्य की सराहना करेंगे!	1
बहुत बढ़िया फ़िल्म!	1
साथ ही कहानी और अभिनय कमजोर था।	0
लगभग 4 बजे मैंने इसे खरीदा, लगभग 8pm पर मैंने देखना शुरू किया, लगभग 8.15pm मैंने तेजी से शेष फिल्म को आगे बढ़ाया, यह देखने के लिए कि क्या एक मस्तिष्क के साथ एक इंसान के लिए कुछ भी नहीं बचा है ... लेकिन वहाँ नहीं था।	0
किसी भी तरह से, यह बेकार है।	0

डी स्नाइडर सिर्फ सादा चूसता है।	0
वह अभिनय नहीं कर सकता (कम से कम डरावना खलनायक जो मैंने कभी देखा है), वह नहीं लिख सकता (क्या उसने अपनी नींद में यह लानत फिल्म लिखी थी?	0
मैं पूरे लानत की बात से ऊब गया था।	0
अभिनय बेकार है, संगीत बेकार है, स्क्रिप्ट बेकार है, पेसिंग बेकार है, विशेष एफएक्स चूसना, निर्देशन बेकार है ... मूल रूप से, यह फिल्म बेकार है।	0
यह फिल्म एक गंभीर और परिष्कृत थ्रिलर / हॉरर फ्लिक बनने की कोशिश करती है और यह बुरी तरह से विफल हो जाती है।	0
यह संभवतः मेरे पूरे जीवन में अब तक की सबसे कम प्रभावी और पूरी तरह से अनधिकृत फिल्मों में से एक है।	0
सेल्युलाइड कचरा का एक टुकड़ा सेल्युलाइड पर कब्जा कर लिया।	0

मुझे नहीं पता कि सीज़न फाइव में क्या हुआ, क्या गड़बड़ है।	0
श्रृंखला को एक साथ रखने वाला एकमात्र सुसंगत धागा था, लेनिन पार्कर और अनीता लासेलवा के शांत प्रदर्शनों में दो तालों के रूप में अद्भुत विचार-विमर्श संघर्ष का अद्भुत प्रदर्शन था।	0
अब यह एक ऐसी फिल्म है जिसे मैं वास्तव में नापसंद करता हूं।	0
यह मुख्य रूप से 90 के दशक की सबसे बोरिंग हॉरर फिल्मों में से एक है क्योंकि यह धीमी गति से शुरू होती है और उबाऊ वातावरण में केंद्र बनती है।	0
कठपुतलियों को कठपुतली मास्टर 80 के फ्लिक्स की तरह नहीं, बल्कि अच्छे से देखा जाता है।	0
कहानी लंगड़ी है, दिलचस्प नहीं है और कभी भी कठपुतलियों की भयावह उत्पत्ति की व्याख्या नहीं करता है।	0
पिछली फिल्मों की तरह मृत्यु दृश्य नहीं हैं और f / x भयानक हैं।	0
मुझे लगा कि पहली बार मैं इसे देख रहा हूं, इसलिए मैं इसे अनिद्रा के लिए सिफारिश कर सकता हूं।	0
तथ्य यह है कि, यह फिल्म एक अद्भुत, दिल को छू लेने वाली कहानी है, जिसमें दो लोग अपने सपनों का पीछा कर रहे हैं।	1
&quot;नर्स बेट्टी&quot; के बारे में सबसे अच्छी बात यह अप्रत्याशित है।	1
निर्देशक नील लाबूट सपने को वास्तविकता से अलग करने के लिए क्रूर हिंसा का उपयोग करते हैं, और साथ ही साथ छूने वाले नाटक, और प्रफुल्लित करने वाली कॉमेडी, आप कभी नहीं बता सकते कि आगे क्या होने वाला है।	1
अन्यथा, इस पर अपना समय बर्बाद मत करो।	0
यह केवल किसी भी वास्तविक रहस्य को बनाने में विफल रहता है।	0
हत्यारे के रूप में, कुछ भी मूल या दूरस्थ रूप से भयावह की उम्मीद न करें।	0
हालांकि, कुछ बहुत अच्छा अभिनय है (कम से कम, इस प्रकार की फिल्म के लिए)।	1
मुझे बहुत खेद है, लेकिन मैं वास्तव में किसी को भी इसकी सिफारिश नहीं कर सकता।	0
सबसे अधिक उबाऊ, व्यर्थ फिल्मों में से एक मैंने कभी देखी है।	0
द्वितीयक प्लॉट लाइन समझ से बाहर है और प्राथमिक प्लॉट लाइन से इसका संबंध रहस्यमय है।	0
नफ़रत थी।	0
यह स्पीड 2 के बाद से सबसे खराब सैंड्रा बुलॉक फिल्म में से एक है, लेकिन यह बहुत बुरा नहीं है।	0
मुझे समझ नहीं आता कि यह कचरा फिल्म स्टोर की अलमारियों में कैसे मिला, यह वास्तविक फिल्म भी नहीं है!	0
मुझे बहुत संदेह है कि कोई भी कभी भी इस कचरे को पसंद कर सकता है।	0
यह फिल्म-निर्माण नहीं है।	0
अभिनय लकड़ी की कठपुतलियों को घूमते हुए और एक किताब से पढ़ते हुए देखने जैसा है, यह कितना बुरा है।	0
तो मैं यहाँ आपको चेतावनी देने के लिए हूँ - आप इस मूवी को किराए पर न लें, यह सबसे विनम्र चीज है जिसे आपने कभी नहीं देखा है!	0
मैंने दूसरे दिन एचबीओ पर इस लघु फिल्म को देखा और बिल्कुल पसंद किया।	1
मुझे महसूस नहीं हुआ कि पिछले दो दृश्यों तक कितना शानदार शॉर्ट है।	1
बेहतरीन लघु फिल्म।	1
उम्मीद है, निर्देशक जेम्स कॉक्स शॉर्ट को फीचर कास्ट फिल्म में उसी कास्ट के साथ बदल सकते हैं, या पूरी नई फिल्म के साथ जीत सकते हैं।	1
मैं जेसिका से सहमत हूं, यह फिल्म काफी खराब है।	0
वर्ण एक आयामी, यहाँ तक कि अच्छे लोग और विशेष रूप से बुरे लोग हैं।	0
कहानी की लाइन पूरी तरह से अनुमानित है।	0
ज्यादा संवाद नहीं, ज्यादा संगीत नहीं, पूरी फिल्म को मूर्तिकला की तरह विस्तृत और सौंदर्यपूर्ण तरीके से फिल्माया गया।	1
मैंने इस फिल्म की तुलना में साबुन ओपेरा को अधिक बुद्धिमान देखा है।	0
खराब किरदार, बुरी कहानी और खराब अभिनय।	0
वास्तव में भयानक है।	0
देखना आसान नहीं है।	0
मजेदार, चालाक, कूल्हे - प्रार्थना की पिछली फिल्म की तरह, प्रचार!	1
यह एक लंबा समय था जब मैंने स्क्रीन पर इतना करिश्माई अभिनेता नहीं देखा।	1
पाओलो सोरेंटिनो ने अकेलेपन के बारे में एक अद्भुत कहानी लिखी है और टोनी ने हाल के वर्षों में फिल्मों में देखे गए सबसे अविस्मरणीय पात्रों में से एक का निर्माण किया है।	1
फिल्म पूरी तरह से सही नहीं है, लेकिन फिल्म की दृष्टि के बाद &#39;टिट्टा डि जिरोलमो&#39; लंबे समय तक आपके साथ रहेगा।	1
मैं इस फिल्म को 9/10 पर रेट करता हूं।	1
मुझे नहीं पता कि यह एमिलियो एस्टेवेज के निर्देशन की शुरुआत थी, लेकिन पेसिंग, इंटरप्ले और पात्रों के विकास के साथ-साथ चरित्र के आसपास के कुछ चतुर कैमरे काम करते हैं जो एस्टेव्ज़ नाटकों में सभी एक प्राकृतिक आंख का सुझाव देते हैं।	1
मार्टिन और एमिलियो के बीच के पारस्परिक संबंध में वही अद्भुत रसायन विज्ञान है जो हमने मार्टिन और चार्ली के साथ वॉल स्ट्रीट में देखा था।	1
कैथी बेट्स अपने पात्रों में सूक्ष्म हताशा और पलायनवाद में अद्भुत हैं; &quot;एट द प्ले इन द फील्ड्स ऑफ द लॉर्ड&quot; में उसके चरित्र पर एक बदलाव।	1
उन पाठकों के लिए जिन्होंने पहले से ही मियाज़ाकी की फिल्मों में से एक को देखा है: वह अभी भी शीर्ष रूप में है और एक और सार्थक अनुभव किया है।	1
यह कभी भी निंदा नहीं करता है, सभी पात्रों के पास अच्छे वास्तविक दिल और विश्वसनीय समस्याएं हैं।	1
दो मुख्य पात्र उन सबसे विश्वसनीय बच्चों में से दो हो सकते हैं जिन्हें मैंने कभी स्क्रीन पर देखा था।	1
वे प्यार करने के लिए बहुत आसान हैं, लेकिन इससे भी ज्यादा आसान है।	1
यह फिल्म महान है - खासकर यदि आप दृश्य कला का आनंद लेते हैं।	1
दो बेटियों की पेंटिंग और तस्वीर को देखने वाले दृश्य सुंदर हैं।	1
कहानी कई बार मज़ेदार और मार्मिक भी होती है।	1
जो लोग यूरोपीय फिल्मों और &quot;कला फिल्मों&quot; को पसंद करते हैं उन्हें यह फिल्म पसंद आएगी।	1
यह वास्तव में एक कला फिल्म है - यह वास्तव में इसमें बहुत सारी कला है।	1
इसे किराए पर लें।	1
हालांकि, आखिरकार इस फिल्म को देखने के बाद, मैंने महसूस किया कि न केवल मेरे पास उस शानदार प्रतिभा का एक बंद दिमाग था, जो मैंने खुद को बार-बार देखने के लिए पाया।	1
यह एक ऐसी फिल्म है जो मुझे कभी भी रूचि नहीं देती है, केवल इसलिए कि यह मुझे सचेत करती है, क्योंकि मैं इसका अर्थ समझने की कोशिश करता हूं।	1
दीप्ति वास्तव में।	1
लेकिन अगर आपको द मेट्रिक्स (और उनके सीक्वेल बेहतर हैं) जैसी फिल्में पसंद हैं, तो मुझे लगता है कि आप इस बात की सराहना करेंगे कि यह फिल्म आपको अच्छा अनुभव देगी।	1
फिल्म को सपने की तरह समझें।	1
बस सुंदर।	1
रिकमैन और स्टोव दोनों ने एक बाल पुस्तक लेखक की इस कहानी में मूठ की भूमिका निभाई है, जो शायद -? - एक विध्वंसक पथ लिखा है।	1
यह एक शानदार मज़ा, तेजी से पुस्तक और एक रात की रात का काफी सटीक चित्रण है।	1
यह पात्रों के जीवन के उतार-चढ़ाव का एक सुखद और गंभीर चित्रण प्रस्तुत करता है।	1
बस आप जो भी करते हैं, &quot;ग्रूव&quot; से बचें क्योंकि यह मानव यातायात के बारे में अच्छा है।	0
यह बहुत बुरा है कि इसमें शामिल सभी लोगों ने क्रो के समर्पण के स्तर को गुणवत्ता के साथ साझा नहीं किया है, अगर वे करते हैं, तो हमारे पास इस उप-बराबर गड़बड़ की तुलना में हमारे हाथों पर एक बेहतर फिल्म होगी।	0
फिल्म पहली बार में थोड़ी धीमी लग रही थी।	0
लेकिन इसने गति पकड़ी और सही पर पहुंच गया।	1
इसमें दिखाया गया कि कैसे सरकार और वैज्ञानिक मानवता और &quot;गैजेट&quot; के कारणों के लिए तर्क देते हैं।	1
मैंने इसका आनंद लिया।	1
मैंने दोस्तों से इसकी सिफारिश की है।	1
मैं विशेष रूप से ड्वाइट शुल्त्स की अभिनय क्षमता से प्रसन्न था।	1
दोनों कलाकार वास्तव में अपने विशेष चरित्र को समझते हैं और एक दृढ़ प्रदर्शन करते हैं।	1
उनकी ऑन-स्क्रीन केमिस्ट्री, पूरी फिल्म के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है, वास्तविक है।	1
फिल्म का संवाद स्वाभाविक है, जीवन के लिए वास्तविक है।	1
लेखक, गोर्मन बेचर्ड ने निस्संदेह अपना होमवर्क किया क्योंकि सभी संदर्भ उद्योग और चरित्र-आयु उपयुक्त हैं।	1
अविश्वसनीय साउंडट्रैक वास्तव में फिल्म के सार को पकड़ लेता है।	1
प्रत्येक ट्रैक भावनाओं को नियंत्रित करता है, वास्तव में दृश्यों और पात्रों में योगदान देता है।	1
निश्चित रूप से देखने लायक ... यह एक तरह से सोची-समझी फिल्म है जो आपको अकेलेपन की अपनी दहलीज पर सवाल उठाने पर मजबूर करती है।	1
हायाओ मियाज़ाकी की स्टूडियो गिबिली की नवीनतम और आठवीं फिल्म, &quot;गक नो यू नो नो पोनीनो&quot; (पोनीनो ऑन द क्लिफ बाय द सी) एक शानदार और मजेदार कल्पनाशील बचपन है।	1
ऐसे समय में जब ऐसा लगता है कि डिज्नी / पिक्सर की सीजीआई कृतियों में फिल्मी एनीमेशन का बोलबाला है, यह जानकर ताज्जुब और सुकून मिलता है कि मियाजाकी अभी भी अपनी आकर्षक और मनमोहक कहानियों को बताने के लिए पारंपरिक रूप से तैयार किए गए एनीमेशन पर निर्भर है।	1
इस फिल्म में पर्याप्त उल्लेखनीय एनीमेशन के बारे में नहीं कहा जा सकता है।	1
कला शैली में क्रेयॉन / पेंसिल चित्र की उपस्थिति है और यह आश्चर्यजनक रूप से रंगीन और काल्पनिक है।	1
यदि आप इस तरह की फिल्म में अभिनय करते हैं, तो आपको खुशी होनी चाहिए कि आप पृथ्वी से जितना संभव हो उतना दूर जा रहे हैं!	0
यह एक 1998 (डीप इम्पैक्ट और आर्मगेडन) में अंतरिक्ष फिल्मों की छोटी लहर पर सर्फ करना चाहता है, और यह हर जगह विफल रहता है।	0
यदि आप अंत तक (सभी सस्ते नाटक और बेकार संवाद द्वारा) अपनी खुद की उल्टी में घुट नहीं गए हैं, तो आपने समय की इस बर्बादी के साथ खुद को मौत के घाट उतार दिया होगा।	0
फिर भी, यह एक सुपर एंडिंग के साथ इस सब के लिए बनाता है जिसमें शक्तिशाली ठंढ द्वारा निकाले जा रहे एक महान समुद्री पोत को दर्शाया गया है।	1
बस उत्कृष्ट कहानी, ठोस अभिनय और फिल्म के रूप को अतिरिक्त बोनस के रूप में देखें।	1
इसके बजाय, हमें एक उबाऊ, खराब हो रही बव्वाबाजी के बारे में बोर फेस्ट मिला।	0
फिर मैंने इसे दो रविवार (मार्च 20, 2005) को फिर से देखा और मैं वास्तव में इसका आनंद लेने लगा और इस बार मैंने पूरी बात को टेप किया।	1
यह एक बहुत अच्छी तरह से काम किया और टीवी मूवी है।	1
जूडिथ लाइट मेरी पसंदीदा अभिनेत्रियों में से एक है और मुझे लगता है कि वह इस फिल्म में शानदार काम करती है!	1
मैं इसे बार-बार देखता रहता हूं।	1
यह एक दुखद फिल्म है, लेकिन बहुत अच्छी है।	1
यदि आपने यह फिल्म नहीं देखी है, तो मैं निश्चित रूप से इसकी सिफारिश करता हूं!	1
वह हमेशा की तरह प्यारी है, यह प्यारी!	1
अभी भी यह काफी दिलचस्प और मनोरंजक है।	1
;) आत्मविश्वास के साथ सिफारिश करें!	1
यह फिल्म कॉमेडी और ड्रामा के साथ अच्छी तरह से संतुलित है और मैंने खुद को अच्छी तरह से एन्जॉय किया।	1
यह ह्यूगो वीविंग को एक सेक्स-ऑब्वर्ड गे रियल एस्टेट सेल्समैन की भूमिका निभाने के लिए एक दंगा था, जो अपने ग्राहकों के घरों का उपयोग ज्वलंत डैरेन (टॉम हॉलैंडर) के साथ करता है।	1

Gran caso y precio!	1
Todo lo que se necesitó fue una caída de aproximadamente 6 pulgadas sobre el mostrador de la cocina y estaba rajado. No estoy impresionado y no me estoy riendo.	0

El soporte técnico de Verizon me guió a través de algunos procedimientos, ninguno de los cuales funcionó y terminé teniendo que hacer un restablecimiento completo, borrando todos mis datos.	0
Calidad de voz, intensidad de señal, llamadas caídas.	0
Se reproduce más fuerte que cualquier otro altavoz de este tamaño; el precio es tan bajo que la mayoría pensaría que falta la calidad, sin embargo, no lo es.	1

el cargador funcionó durante aproximadamente una semana y luego dejó de cargar completamente mi teléfono.	0
Pobre producto.	0
Sin embargo, necesitaba algunas mejores instrucciones.	0
Necesita dos manos para operar la pantalla. Esta interfaz de software tiene una década y no puede competir con los nuevos diseños de software.	0
Funcionó muy bien emparejado con un Treo 700w y como un auricular de Skype en mi PC (usando un transceptor USB Bluetooth).	1
Manténgase alejado de este producto y vaya con las plumas originales de reemplazo de Palm, que vienen en un paquete de tres.	0

El software no solo hizo un gran trabajo al respecto, sino que también pude hacer mis propios tonos de llamada desde mis CD existentes sin una conexión a Internet.	1
Estoy sorprendido de que este sea un cargador de automóvil de buena calidad y no hay muchas críticas al respecto.	1
Estos son fabulosos!	1
Sin embargo, los auriculares BT actualmente no son buenos para juegos en tiempo real, como los shooters en primera persona, ya que el retraso de audio me confunde.	0
Utilicé bitpim (un programa gratuito que puedes encontrar en Internet) para transferir datos al teléfono. El precio del cable fue excelente.	1
Accesorio decepcionante de un buen fabricante.	0
Realizado horrible - amortiguado, sonido metálico entrante y eco severo para los que están al otro lado de la llamada.	0
Muy resistente al viento.	1
Obviamente tienen un servicio al cliente terrible, por lo que obtienes lo que pagas.	0
No duran para siempre, pero no es demasiado costoso de reemplazar. Fácil de operar y el sonido es mucho mejor que otros que he probado.	1
Me puse en contacto con la compañía y me dijeron que, aunque la unidad todavía estaba en garantía, si no podía presentar mi recibo no tenía suerte.	0
¡Linksys debería tener alguna forma de cambiar un teléfono defectuoso por una unidad de renovación o algo así!	0
El teléfono es resistente como todos los teléfonos con barra de Nokia.	1

Finalmente, después de tres o cuatro veces, el resorte del pestillo se rompió y no pude usarlo más en la visera.	0
La parte de manos libres funciona bien, pero luego el automóvil intenta descargar la libreta de direcciones y el Treo se reinicia. En general, todavía califico este dispositivo como alto.	1
Hable sobre el servicio al cliente INÚTIL.	0
Se sentía demasiado ligero y &quot;metálico&quot;.	0
Esto no se ajusta al Palm Tungsten E2 y se rompió la primera vez que intenté enchufarlo.	0

Bluetooth no funciona, el teléfono se bloquea, las pantallas simplemente parpadean y ahora solo hace llamadas al azar mientras estoy en mi bolsillo cerrado.	0
Realmente horrible	0
Funciona bien en mi teléfono celular Motorola 325, y mucho mejor que la batería gastada.	1
El volumen del timbre es MUY bueno (tienes opciones de qué tan alto)	1
Y ninguno de los tonos es aceptable.	0
el balance de color de la cámara es HORRIBLE.	0
Claramente, este producto no está listo para el horario de máxima audiencia, no me importa lo genial que se vea, si no puede decir que está entrando una llamada, no tiene valor.	0
¡Me encantan los tonos de llamada porque son muy optimistas!	1
¡Falsificaciones chinas abundan!	0
Fácil de emparejar con mi Samsung Cell.	1

NO compre si desea usar la funda.	0
El teléfono también puede tomar excelentes fotos e incluso videoclips.	1
No te hace ver genial.	0
Debido a que ambas orejas están ocupadas, el fondo no distrae en absoluto.	1
Ajuste cómodo: necesita que sus auriculares estén cómodos durante al menos una hora a la vez, si no durante todo un día.	1
Además, el teléfono no parece aceptar nada excepto los mp3 CBR, preferiblemente copiados por Windows Media Player.	0
No se puede superar el precio de estos.	1
* Viene con una luz fuerte que puede usar para iluminar las tomas de su cámara e incluso emitir señales SOS (¡en serio!	1
Ligero y funciona bien.	1
Así que ten cuidado.	0
Me encanta este cable, me permite conectar cualquier dispositivo mini-USB a mi PC.	1
Entonces, cualquiera que esté cerca de usted escuchará parte de su conversación.	0
Esto es genial porque la mayoría de los casos solo están abiertos allí, lo que permite que la pantalla se raye.	1
Compré este teléfono como reemplazo de mi StarTac y lo he lamentado desde entonces.	0
Parece superar realmente la batería original de China que vino con mi V325i.	1
No puedo almacenar nada más que números de teléfono en la SIM.	0
Dura realmente menos de 3 minutos, si realmente trato de usar el teléfono. Mi esposa tiene el mismo teléfono con el mismo problema.	0
Mala calidad.	0

No vale la pena.	0
El teléfono se bloqueó por completo y ahora tengo que reemplazarlo.	0

En el lapso de una hora, hice que dos personas exclamaran &quot;¡Vaya! ¿Es ese el nuevo teléfono en la televisión?&quot;	1
Siempre he usado auriculares con cable y la libertad de la conexión inalámbrica es muy útil.	1
Este caso ha pasado la marca de un año y, aunque muestra signos de desgaste, es 100% funcional.	1
Aparte de eso, el cuero es agradable y suave; el ajuste es muy ajustado; El corte para la cara es una buena forma.	1
Tiene todo lo que necesito y no podría pedir más.	1
Después de recibir y usar el producto por solo 2 días, se rompió.	0

Recibí mi auricular a tiempo y quedé satisfecho con él.	1
Estaba muy contento de ver que podía reemplazar mi funda giratoria bien transitada por mi tapa de Blackberry.	1
Mi hermana también tiene uno y le encanta.	1
Buena calidad.	1
Esta es, con mucho, la peor compra que he hecho en Amazon.	0
Excelente auricular de doble propósito.	1
¡Excelente!.	1
No funciona para escuchar música con el 8125 cingular.	0
Parece completamente seguro, agarrándome del cinturón y manteniendo el iPhone dentro.	1
La línea bottowm ... otro truco inútil y barato de Sprint.	0
Tener problemas con el volumen.	0
Lo único bueno es que se adapta cómodamente a orejas pequeñas.	1
ADVERTENCIA - ¡NO COMPRE!	0
Estoy emparejando esto con mi iphone, y hasta ahora no podría estar más feliz con él.	1
Cuando se abre, la conexión de la batería se rompe y el dispositivo se apaga.	0
No quería que el clip pasara por encima de mi oreja, causando molestias.	0
El mejor auricular de todos los tiempos!	1
No confíes en su sitio web y no esperes ningún soporte útil.	0
Era tan ruidoso. Me alegra decir que el Plantronics 510 mantiene una conexión perfecta con mi celular y sin estática durante el uso normal.	1
El altavoz es de baja calidad, por lo que los tonos de llamada suenan muy baratos.	0
Se adapta cómodamente, viene con tres tamaños de puntas de auriculares.	1
Excelente producto por el precio.	1
Mala recepción.	0
¡Este producto es una MIERDA china de muy alta calidad!	0
Era bastante cómodo en el oído.	1
Gran telefono.	1
No compre este producto, ¡falla!	0
Todo acerca de este producto está mal. Primero	0
El emparejamiento de los dos dispositivos fue tan fácil que apenas tardé un par de minutos en comenzar a hacer llamadas con la función de marcación por voz.	1
Esto fue completamente confuso al principio, lo que me hizo perder un par de contactos muy, muy importantes.	0
Terrible soporte para teléfono.	0
Los recortes y botones se colocan perfectamente.	1
Me encanta poder usar un auricular para teléfono fijo y celular.	1
El problema es que las orejeras están hechas de material débil y se rompen fácilmente.	0
No es tan guapo como la imagen de AMAZON lo hace ver.	0
Pero a pesar de estos pocos defectos, este caso es de una calidad excepcional y vale la pena los costos adicionales de poseer un producto OEM oficial.	1
¿Qué tan estúpido es eso?	0
Puedo escuchar mientras conduzco en el automóvil, y por lo general ni siquiera tengo que ponerlo en su configuración más ruidosa.	1
Vendedor enviado rápidamente y mucho más barato que los competidores.	1
Buen espectáculo, Samsung.	1
Así que compré unos 10 de estos y ahorré mucho dinero.	1
Siempre se corta y emite un pitido y luego dice que la señal ha fallado.	0
No pude resolverlo	0
Mi teléfono sonaba bien (no genial, bien), pero el teléfono de mi esposa era casi totalmente ininteligible, no podía entender ni una palabra.	0
Así que tuve que sacar la batería del teléfono y volver a armarla.	0
Si bien logré doblar el resorte de láminas en su lugar, el metal ahora tiene suficiente tensión que se romperá en la próxima gota.	0
¡El estampado leopardo es maravillosamente salvaje!	1
Funciona para mi.	1
Saggy, flojo pedazo de basura.	0
mucho mejor que las cajas de plástico duro.	1
También tuvo un nuevo problema.	0
¡Feliz hasta ahora!	1
teléfono genial	1
Funciona bien	1
Motorola finalmente obtuvo la calidad de voz de un auricular bluetooth correcto.	1
Pierde la conexión con el teléfono incluso cuando está a un par de pies entre los dos.	0
pero es genial, realmente lo recomendaría	1
Hace que sea más fácil mantenerse al día con mi bluetooth cuando no lo estoy usando.	0
Como dije anteriormente ... ¡BASTANTE INÚTIL!	0
¡Nunca lo conseguí!	0
Este par de auriculares es el peor que he tenido en cuanto a sonido.	0
[...] por el desagüe debido a un chasquido débil!	0
No carga el teléfono Cingular (ATT) 8525.	0
Obtiene minutos adicionales para poder realizar la llamada y no quedar interrumpido &quot;.	1
Sin embargo, después de aproximadamente un año, el fliptop comenzó a aflojarse y tambalearse y, finalmente, mi pantalla se oscureció y no pude recibir ni hacer llamadas.	0
Seguí atrapando el cable en el asiento y tuve que sacar el teléfono para apagarlo.	0
El auricular cumple con mis requisitos, así que estoy contento con mi compra.	1
Logitech Bluetooth Headset es un 10 !.	1
Me gusta el hecho de que se apoya ligeramente en la oreja, en lugar de adentro.	1
Muchos sitios web han calificado este muy buen teléfono y yo también.	1
He probado estos cables con mi computadora y mi iPod y funciona bien.	1
El micrófono hay una broma, y el volumen es bastante bajo.	0
Los estoy devolviendo.	0
No mantengo una conexión con la computadora mientras está en mi regazo.	0
Es fácil de encender y apagar cuando está en el automóvil y los controles de volumen son bastante accesibles.	1
He tenido el mío durante aproximadamente un año y esta Navidad compré algunos para el resto de la familia.	1
De lo contrario, fácil de instalar y usar, sonido claro.	1
bonito cuero	1
Tuve que comprar una caja diferente.	0
Es un placer usarlo.	1
Muy decepcionado con esta empresa.	0
Muy satisfecho con eso.	1
No me cobró nada.	0
Este es el teléfono para 2005 ... Acabo de comprar mi S710a y todo lo que puedo decir es ¡GUAU!	1
Los botones son muy pequeños.	0
Solo leer las especificaciones solo te hace decir WOW.	1
Me encanta .. Gran brazalete.	1
Realmente me gusta este producto sobre Motorola porque es mucho más claro en el auricular y el micrófono.	1
Sin embargo, los teclados son tan pequeños que a veces llego a los botones equivocados.	0
Cambié el Sony Ericson Z500a por esto y estoy bastante contento con esa decisión.	1
Estaba muy impresionado con el precio de los casos.	1
También hace que sea más fácil aferrarse a él.	1
Utilizo este producto en un centro de control de motores donde hay mucho zumbido de alto voltaje del equipo, ¡y funciona muy bien!	1
Es muy facil.	1
No puedo hacer llamadas en ciertos lugares.	0
Sin embargo, mi niña se quejaba de que en algún momento el teléfono no se despierta como lo hace el teléfono normal.	0
Hermoso estilo sin embargo.	1
Esta compañía me cobra una tarifa de reposición y todavía no me devolvió el reembolso.	0
Estoy tratando de devolverlo para obtener un reembolso.	0
Lo enchufé solo para descubrir que nada funcionaba.	0
Producto excelente.	1
La pieza del auricular se rompe fácilmente.	0
Producto pésimo.	0
Este teléfono se esfuerza mucho por hacer todo, pero falla por su capacidad de ser un teléfono.	0
Es el mejor cargador que he visto en el mercado hasta ahora.	1
¡EL TELÉFONO MÁS DULCE!	1
:-) Oh, el cargador parece funcionar bien.	1
Se ajusta de manera tan segura que ni siquiera es necesario utilizar el gancho para la oreja y el sonido se dirige mejor a través del canal auditivo.	1
No hay suficiente volumen.	0
Problema de eco ... Muy insatisfactorio	0
solo podías tomar 2 videos a la vez y la calidad era muy pobre.	0
No malgastes tu dinero.	0
Voy a tener que ser el primero en evaluar negativamente este producto.	0
El adaptador no proporciona suficiente corriente de carga.	0
Había tanto entusiasmo por este teléfono que supuse que era el mejor, mi error.	0
Tampoco puede tomar fotos con él en el caso porque el lente está cubierto.	0
El teléfono se cae fácilmente.	0
No funcionó, la gente no puede oírme cuando hablo.	0
La función de mensajes de texto es realmente difícil de usar.	0
Estoy realmente decepcionado, todo lo que tengo ahora es un cargador que no funciona.	0
Doloroso en la oreja.	0
Duró un día y luego explotó.	0
decepcionado.	0
Tipo de fracasos.	0
La pantalla se mancha fácilmente porque toca la oreja y la cara.	0
Qué basura ... Perdí más llamadas en este teléfono.	0
El artículo no coincide con la imagen.	0
Lo único que me decepciona es el puerto infrarrojo (irda).	0
¡No puede contestar llamadas con la unidad, nunca trabajó una vez!	0
Una película muy, muy lenta y sin rumbo sobre un joven angustiado y a la deriva.	0
No estoy seguro de quién estaba más perdido: los personajes chatos o la audiencia, casi la mitad de los cuales se fueron.	0
Intentando ser ingeniosa con ángulos de cámara en blanco y negro e inteligentes, la película decepcionó, se volvió aún más ridícula, ya que la actuación fue pobre y la trama y las líneas casi inexistentes.	0
Muy poca música o algo de qué hablar.	0
La mejor escena de la película fue cuando Gerardo está tratando de encontrar una canción que se le pase por la cabeza.	1
El resto de la película carece de arte, encanto, significado ... Si se trata de vacío, funciona, supongo porque está vacío.	0
Perdido dos horas.	0
Vi la película hoy y pensé que era un buen esfuerzo, buenos mensajes para los niños.	1
Un poco predecible	0
Me encantó el casting de Jimmy Buffet como profesor de ciencias.	1
Y esos búhos eran adorables.	1
La película mostró mucho de Florida en su mejor momento, lo hizo parecer muy atractivo.	1
Las canciones fueron las mejores y los Muppets fueron tan divertidos.	1
Fue tan genial.	1
Esta es una película muy &quot;justo en el caso&quot; que ofrece casi todo en su cara.	1
Tuvo un promedio de actuación de la persona principal, y fue un presupuesto bajo como se puede ver claramente.	0
Esta crítica está muy atrasada, ya que considero que A Tale of Two Sisters es la mejor película de la historia.	1
Pondré esta gema contra cualquier película en términos de guión, cinematografía, actuación, postproducción, edición, dirección o cualquier otro aspecto de la realización de películas.	1
Es prácticamente perfecto en todos ellos: una verdadera obra maestra en un mar de falsas &quot;obras maestras&quot;.	1
&quot;La estructura de esta película es fácilmente la más estrechamente construida en la historia del cine.	1
No puedo pensar en ninguna otra película en la que ocurra algo de vital importancia cada dos minutos.	1
En otras palabras, el nivel de contenido de esta película es suficiente para llenar fácilmente una docena de otras películas.	1
¿Cómo puede alguien en su sano juicio pedir algo más de una película que esto?	1
Es simplemente la forma más alta y más superlativa de cine imaginable.	1
Sí, esta película requiere una cantidad bastante significativa de resolución de rompecabezas, pero las piezas se unen para crear una imagen hermosa.	1
Este cortometraje ciertamente no tira golpes.	0
Los gráficos están lejos de ser la mejor parte del juego.	0
Este es el mejor juego TH de la serie.	1
Se merece un fuerte amor.	1
Es un juego loco.	1
Hay niveles masivos, personajes desbloqueables masivos ... es solo un juego masivo.	1
Gasta tu dinero en este juego.	1
Este es el tipo de dinero que se desperdicia adecuadamente.	1
En realidad, los gráficos eran buenos en ese momento.	1
Hoy los gráficos son basura.	0
Como dicen en Canadá, este es el juego divertido, sí.	1
Este juego es genial.	1
Cómpralo, juega, disfrútalo, ámalo.	1
Es PURO BRILLO.	1
Esta fue una película condenada desde su concepción.	0
La idea misma era poco convincente: tomar un personaje secundario de una película PG-13 mediocre y hacer una secuela completa mientras cambia su tono a una película familiar con clasificación PG.	0
No me interesaba lo más mínimo.	0
No solo confirmó que la película sería divertida y genérica, sino que también logró regalar TODA la película; y no exagero: cada momento, cada punto de la trama, cada broma se cuenta en el trailer.	0
Pero simplemente no es gracioso.	0
Pero incluso el talentoso Carrell no puede salvar esto.	0
A sus compañeros de reparto no les va mucho mejor, con personas como Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill y Ed Helms simplemente desperdiciados.	0
La historia en sí es predecible y perezosa.	0
El único trabajo de efectos reales es la presencia de todos los animales, y la integración de esos en las escenas es uno de los peores y más obvios trabajos de pantalla azul / verde que he visto.	0
Pero lo que sea que les costó tanto, no se tradujo en calidad, eso es seguro.	0
La película tiene éxito a pesar de, o quizás debido a, un presupuesto obviamente escaso.	1
Me alegro de que la película no haya sido la opción más obvia, como ciertamente hubiera sido una película menor.	1
Además de tener una de las canciones más encantadoras jamás escritas, French Cancan también cuenta con una de las damas más lindas que jamás haya aparecido en la pantalla.	1
Es difícil no enamorarse perdidamente de esa chica.	1
En lo negativo, es lo suficientemente insípido como para causar arrepentimiento por otras 2 horas de vida desperdiciadas frente a la pantalla.	0
Largo, llorón y sin sentido.	0
Pero recomiendo esperar a sus esfuerzos futuros, deje ir este.	0
Excelente reparto, argumento, actuaciones.	1
Totalmente creíble	1
Anne Heche fue completamente convincente.	1
La interpretación de Sam Shepard de un entusiasta Marine fue aleccionadora.	1
Me senté clavado en la pantalla del televisor.	1
En general, le doy a este un rotundo 9 de 10.	1
Creo que Tom Hanks es un buen actor.	1
Disfruté leyendo este libro a mis hijos cuando eran pequeños.	1
Estaba muy decepcionado con la película.	0
Un personaje es totalmente molesto con una voz que me da la sensación de las uñas en una pizarra.	0
Hay una escena de tren / montaña rusa totalmente innecesaria.	0
No había absolutamente ninguna calidez o encanto en estas escenas o personajes.	0
Esta película me irrita totalmente.	0
Las actuaciones no mejoran con la improvisación, porque los actores ahora tienen el doble de qué preocuparse: no solo si están entregando bien la línea, sino si la línea en sí es buena.	0
Y, sinceramente, a menudo no es muy bueno.	0
A menudo, el diálogo no sigue realmente de una línea a otra, ni se ajusta al entorno.	0
Cruje con una energía juvenil e impredecible, pero, sinceramente, me resultó difícil seguirlo y concentrarme en él serpentea muy mal.	0
Hay algunas cosas geniales en general.	1
Sin embargo, no diría que valen 2 horas de tu tiempo.	0
Los constructores de suspenso fueron buenos, y simplemente cruzan la línea de G a PG.	1
Me gustaron especialmente las opciones no cliché con los padres; en otras películas, podría predecir el diálogo literalmente, pero la escritura en esta película hizo mejores selecciones.	1
Si quieres una película que no sea asquerosa pero que te dé escalofríos, esta es una gran opción.	1
Alexander Nevsky es una gran película.	1
Es un artista de cine increíble, uno de los más importantes que haya vivido.	1
Me alegro de que esta pieza pretenciosa de mierda no haya hecho lo planeado por el Dodge stratus Big Shots ... Ayudará a los cineastas que no están en el &quot;negocio del cine&quot; muy restringido de Québec.	0
Esta es la primera película a la que le he dado un 10 en años.	1
Si alguna vez hubo una película que necesitaba el boca a boca para promocionar, esta es la oportunidad.	1
En general, la película es interesante y estimulante.	1
Además, tenía un buen ritmo y se adaptaba a su tiempo de ejecución relativamente corto.	1
Dale una mirada a este.	1
Le di un 10	1
The Wind and the Lion está bien escrito y tiene una actuación excelente.	1
Es un verdadero clásico.	1
En realidad, resultó ser bastante decente en lo que respecta a las películas de terror / suspenso de la lista B.	1
Definitivamente vale la pena echarle un vistazo.	1
El problema fue el guión.	0
Fue horrendo.	0
No había nada creíble al respecto.	0
El único suspenso que sentía era la frustración por lo retardadas que eran las chicas.	0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN es una película excelente que es predecible e impredecible al mismo tiempo.	1
Las escenas a menudo son divertidas y ocasionalmente conmovedoras cuando los personajes evalúan sus vidas y hacia dónde van.	1
El elenco de actores veteranos es más que un simple viaje de nostalgia.	1
La representación de Ursula Burton de la monja es conmovedora y divertida al mismo tiempo sin burlarse de las monjas o la iglesia.	1
Si está buscando una película con un elenco fantástico, buena música (incluida una versión de Shirley Jones de &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;) y un final alentador, inténtelo.	1
No creo que te decepciones.	1
Francamente, después de Cotton club e Unfaithful, fue un poco vergonzoso ver a Lane y Gere en esta película, porque es MALO.	0
La actuación fue mala, los diálogos fueron extremadamente superficiales y poco sinceros.	0
Era demasiado predecible, incluso para una película de chicas.	0
Demasiado políticamente correcto.	0
Muy decepcionante.	0
Lo único que realmente valió la pena ver fue el paisaje y la casa, porque es hermosa.	1
Amo a Lane, pero nunca la he visto en una película tan horrible.	0
Una hora y media desearía poder traer de vuelta.	0
Pero en términos de escritura es muy fresca y audaz.	1
La actuación ayuda a la escritura muy bien (tal vez la hermana idiota sabia podría haber jugado mejor), y es una verdadera alegría verla.	1
La dirección y la cinematografía no son tan buenas.	0
La película era tan aburrida que a veces me encontraba ocupada mirando en el periódico en lugar de mirarla (¡nunca antes había sucedido durante una película de Columbo!	0
), y a veces era tan vergonzoso que tuve que mirar hacia otro lado.	0
La dirección parece demasiado pretenciosa.	0
Las escenas con la &quot;vecina tan madura&quot; son un lugar equivocado.	0
Y, en general, las líneas y la trama son más débiles que el episodio promedio.	0
La escena en la que debatieron si despedir o no al trompetista (que fue acusado falsamente por el asesinato) es puro horror, realmente estúpido.	0
Sin embargo, se deben dar algunos aplausos al &quot;preludio&quot;.	1
Realmente me gustó eso.	1
Una gran película de un gran director.	1
La película lo tenía al borde de su asiento y le daba un poco de miedo ir a su automóvil al final de la noche.	1
La música en la película también es muy bonita.	1
Aconsejaría a cualquiera que vaya a verlo.	1
¡Brillante!	1
10/10	1
Esta película me gustó demasiado.	1
Mi único problema es que pensé que el actor que interpretaba al villano era Michael Ironside.	0
Sacudió mi mundo y es sin duda una visita obligada para cualquiera que no tenga salidas sociales o físicas.	1
Sin embargo, esto no compensa el hecho de que, en general, esta fue una película tremendamente aburrida.	0
NO había química entre Ben Affleck y Sandra Bullock en esta película, y no podía entender por qué consideraría incluso dejar a su futura esposa por esta chica que supuestamente fue noqueado.	0
Hubo varios momentos en la película que simplemente no necesitaban estar allí y eran extremadamente lentos.	0
Esta fue una nueva versión pobre de &quot;My Best Friends Wedding&quot;.	0
En general, una gran decepción.	0
No puedo creer que los actores hayan aceptado hacer esta &quot;película&quot;.	0
No podía soportar verlo por mucho tiempo por miedo a perder el coeficiente intelectual	0
Supongo que nadie en la red que transmitió este regate lo vio antes de ponerlo.	0
Las calificaciones de IMDB solo bajan a 1 por horrible, es hora de obtener algunos números negativos allí para casos como estos.	0
Vi &quot;Mirrormask&quot; anoche y fue una experiencia insatisfactoria.	0
Desafortunadamente, la inexperiencia de dirección significaba que la escena tras escena pasaba con poca tensión o conflicto dramático.	0
Estos son los temas centrales de la película y se manejan de manera inepta, estereotípica y sin profundidad de imaginación.	0
Todas las imágenes bonitas del mundo no pueden compensar un trabajo que es defectuoso en el núcleo.	0
Es una hora y media de pérdida de tiempo, después de que un montón de estudiantes de secundaria muy lindos se quejen y lloren por la vida.	0
No puedes relacionarte con ellos, demonios, apenas puedes entenderlos.	0
Este es definitivamente un clásico de culto que vale la pena ver y compartir con otros.	1
Esta película es un desastre puro, la historia es estúpida y la edición es lo peor que he visto, te confunde increíblemente.	0
El pez está mal hecho y algunas de sus tomas bajo el agua se repiten mil veces en la película.	0
Una película realmente, realmente mala.	0
La actuación es terrible, y la escritura es peor.	0
La única forma posible de canjear esta película sería como forraje MST3K.	0
Pagué demasiado	0
Además, es un verdadero placer ver a Anthony Quinn interpretando a Crazy Horse.	1
¡Era tan aburrido!	0
No hay trama en absoluto!	0
De nuevo, no hay trama en absoluto.	0
¡Horrible!	0
¡La peor hora y media de mi vida! ¡Dios mío!	0
¡Tuve que salir del teatro unos minutos para sentir alivio!	0
Odio las películas así.	0
Sí, la película apestaba bastante.	0
¡NO HAY PARCELA O HISTORIA!	0
Si vas a ver esta película, trae una almohada o una novia / novio para mantenerte ocupado durante todo el tiempo.	0
Horrible.	0
Creo que nunca he ido al cine y no me ha gustado tanto.	0
Fue bueno que las entradas solo costaran cinco dólares porque me enojaría si hubiera pagado $ 7.50 por ver esta basura.	0
NADIE se identifica con estos personajes porque son todos recortes de cartón y estereotipos (o previsiblemente estereotipos inversos).	0
Esta es una mala película, con una mala escritura y buenos actores ... una caricatura fea creada por Paul Haggis para personas que no pueden manejar nada más que los trazos audaces en la narración ... una imagen pintada con lápices de colores.	0
Crash es una nada deprimente, que provoca emoción, pero no te enseña nada si ya sabes que el racismo y los prejuicios son cosas malas.	0
Aún así, me gusta esta película por su empoderamiento de las mujeres; No hay suficientes películas como esta.	1
Su cerebro intentará apagarse como parte de un impulso primario de autoconservación.	0
Me quedé destrozado por la experiencia de ver esta &#39;película&#39; y tardé unas buenas dos horas en recuperarme por completo.	0
Esta película ahora se une a Revenge of the Boogeyman y Zombiez como parte de la trinidad infernal de las películas de terror.	0
Ciertamente no me refiero a esta distinción en el buen sentido.	0
Me refiero a esto de una manera terrible.	0
Esta película no tiene características redentoras.	0
Todo es atroz.	0
El trabajo de cámara sin arte nos presenta sin cesar el entorno más feo que se pueda imaginar, es decir	0
La historia es más que estúpida.	0
El guión es ... ¿había un guión?	0
Los niños son molestos.	0
El líder no tiene carisma.	0
Totalmente sin mérito en ningún nivel, esto es similar a la tortura.	0
Incluso lo diré de nuevo: esto es tortura.	0
Tal vez habría una explicación razonable para esta atrocidad.	0
No es un viaje agradable de autodescubrimiento.	0
Altamente no recomendado.	0
Si esta premisa suena estúpida, es porque lo es.	0
Sí, es tan malo.	0
Nada en absoluto para recomendar.	0
Una excelente actuación de la Sra.	1
Garbo, quien demostró desde el principio que sus talentos podían trasladarse desde la era silenciosa (quería ver parte de su trabajo silencioso, pero Netflix no parece estar almacenándolos.	1
También es genial ver que la reconocida guionista silenciosa Frances Marion no se ha perdido un paso para pasar del silencio al sonido.	1
Esta película sufrió debido a la escritura, necesitaba más suspenso.	0
Había demasiados primeros planos.	0
Pero aparte de eso, la película parecía arrastrarse y los héroes realmente no trabajaban por su libertad.	0
Pero esta película es definitivamente un alquiler por debajo del promedio.	0
&quot;¡Te va a encantar!	1
Esta película es MALA.	0
Muy malo.	0
La película es demasiado larga.	0
Este es definitivamente uno de los malos.	0
La película que recibí fue una película de gran calidad para su edad.	1
John Wayne hizo un trabajo increíble por ser tan joven en la industria del cine.	1
Su presencia en la pantalla brilló el pensamiento a pesar de que había otros actores principales en la pantalla con él.	1
Creo que es imprescindible ver una película más antigua de John Wayne.	1
Realmente no veo cómo alguien podría disfrutar esta película.	0
No creo haber visto una película tan aburrida como esta basura autocomplaciente.	0
Probablemente hubiera sido mejor si el director no hubiera pasado la mayor parte de la película exhibiendo su propio trabajo de arte, lo que realmente no es tan notable.	0
Otra cosa que realmente no me gustó es que cuando un personaje recibe un puñetazo en la cara, un galón de sangre brotaría poco después.	0
Jamie Foxx es absolutamente Ray Charles.	1
Su actuación es simplemente genial.	1
Es dueño de la película, al igual que Spacek era propietaria de &quot;Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter&quot; y Quaid era dueño de &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;.	1
&quot;De hecho, es difícil recordar que la parte de Ray Charles está siendo actuada y no interpretada por el hombre mismo.	1
Ray Charles es legendario.	1
La vida de Ray Charles proporcionó un excelente material biográfico para la película, que va mucho más allá de ser solo otra película sobre un músico.	1
Hitchcock es un gran director.	1
Irónicamente, la mayoría de sus películas me parecen una pérdida total de tiempo.	0
En segundo lugar, Hitchcock perfeccionó bastante la película de suspenso y persecución.	1
Es esta complacencia al público lo que sabotea la mayoría de sus películas.	0
Por lo tanto, toda la historia carece de cierta energía.	0
La trama simplemente retumba como una máquina, dependiendo desesperadamente de la adición de nuevas escenas.	0
Existen los defectos lógicos habituales de Hitchcock.	0
Mishima es extremadamente poco interesante.	0
Esta es una película fría y poco notable sobre un autor que vive / trabaja en una cultura fría y abstrusa.	0
Las recreaciones planas no atraen su atención porque son emocionalmente a la deriva y escalofriantes.	0
Y el resto simplemente se sienta allí siendo horrible ... con soldados cantando canciones sobre la masculinidad a la que se comprometen, desgarradores sobre la pureza, la admiración de las espadas, etc.	0
Él puede aburrirte en pedazos y matar el impulso de una película, más rápido que nadie.	0
Schrader ha hecho un currículum lleno de pésimas películas de aficionados.	0
Cuando vi esta película por primera vez, en los años 80, me encantó.	1
Estaba totalmente fascinado por la música, el baile ... todo.	1
Sin embargo, recientemente volví a verlo todo en DVD, y me sorprendió completamente lo extremadamente estúpida que era la historia, cómo contenía agujeros, inconsistencias y, francamente, mucha basura, y lo horrible que era el baile.	0
Quiero decir, en un mundo realista, NUNCA se habría metido en ese repertorio de ballet ... Todo fue bastante patético.	0
Los desarrollos de los personajes también carecían de profundidad.	0
Woa, habla de horrible.	0
No malgastes tu tiempo.	0
Fue demasiado horrible.	0
El peor y más sagrado diálogo ... podría seguir y seguir.	0
Pero lo que realmente lo hizo imposible de ver fue la dirección.	0
Los pobres actores.	0
Ni siquiera se puede saber si tienen algún talento porque no solo tienen líneas patéticas para hablar, sino que el director no les hizo nada.	0
Si revisas la filmografía del director en este sitio, verás por qué esta película no tuvo oportunidad.	0
Esto ni siquiera sería bueno como una película hecha para televisión.	0
Si las buenas intenciones hicieron una gran película, entonces esta película podría ser una de las mejores películas que se hayan hecho.	1
La película tiene grandes actores, un director maestro, un tema significativo, al menos un tema significativo, con un trasfondo de cincuentenos de existencia mundial, escenas aéreas que deberían haber emocionado tanto los sentidos como la imaginación, y personajes sobre los que uno podría Profundamente cuidado.	1
Lamentablemente, la película falla.	0
La película carece de interés visual, drama, expresión de sentimientos y celebración del patriotismo que subraya la narrativa.	0
Ninguna actriz ha sido peor utilizada que June Allison en esta película.	0
Sin embargo, disfruto viéndolo.	1
Desafortunadamente, esta es una mala película que es simplemente mala.	0
¡Mal guión, mala dirección y una actuación horrible hacen que este sea simplemente malo!	0
El diálogo apestaba.	0
La cinematografía, si se le puede llamar así, apestaba.	0
La banda sonora apestaba.	0
La actuación apestaba.	0
Las secuencias del concierto simplemente apestaron.	0
Eso estuvo bien.	1
Eso fue divertido.	1
Fue tan gracioso.	1
En general, esta película fue basura barata.	0
Pero esta película no es divertida, considerando lo ridículo que es.	0
Salí sintiéndome enojado.	0
*** SPOILERS *** Cualquier otra cosa que se pueda (o no se pueda decir) al respecto, SURFACE está excelentemente diseñada.	1
La cinematografía es simplemente impresionante (por decir lo menos) y los efectos son nada más que lo último.	1
Conceptualmente, el programa ofrece un poco de todo, y para casi todos (padres, hijos, fanáticos de la fantasía y / o fx).	1
Y tampoco había una sola nota amarga que actuara sabiamente; algo de fundición sorprendentemente sólida, aquí.	1
A fin de cuentas, un trabajo muy bien hecho.	1
Gracias a Dios, una película como esta fue hecha y lanzada.	1
¡Una de las mejores películas mexicanas de la historia!, Y una de las menos entendidas, incluso por los mismos mexicanos, sin importar cuán identificados se hayan sentido con ella.	1
Se clasifica altamente como un gran drama de crimen negro, actuaciones increíbles de Belmondo y Lino Ventura.	1
La atención prestada a cada personaje, y las representaciones psicológicas complejas, que detallan lealtad, traición, amor y esperanza, son tremendas.	1
Es un excelente drama, un excelente thriller y una excelente película.	1
Allá arriba con lo mejor de Melville.	1
Todo sobre esta película es simplemente increíble.	1
Realmente haces este viaje a través de los ojos y el alma de un niño.	1
BLACK WATER es un thriller que logra trascender por completo sus limitaciones (es una película independiente) al subvertir continuamente las expectativas para emerger como una experiencia intensa.	1
Las actuaciones son reales y apasionantes, el cocodrilo está muy bien hecho, de hecho, si se cree que el sitio web de Black Water es porque usaron cocodrilos reales y la ubicación del pantano es fabulosa.	1
Disfruté muchísimo cuando Christopher Eccleston tomó el control de la TARDIS y la continuación de la serie.	1
No estoy seguro de qué estaba tratando de hacer con esta película.	0
Si fue para convertir mi buen día en una noche de recuerdos inquietantes, supongo que tuvo éxito.	0
Hay muchos lugares hermosos.	1
Fue forzado, como todo en esta película.	0
De nuevo, cojo.	0
Aquí es donde la película realmente me fastidió.	0
Y ni siquiera me hagas comenzar con el trabajo desigual de la cámara.	0
Cuando lo vi en el teatro pensé que me iba a enfermar.	0
Resumen: Los ingenios no fueron ingeniosos.	0
La trama ... bueno, dije que lo dejaría pasar.	0
La actuación fue mala.	0
Muy mal.	0
Incluso Billy Bob no pudo superar el guión, lo que fue peor.	0
Trabajo de cámara, otra vez, malo.	0
Calificación: 1 de 10.	0
¡Un final INCREÍBLE para posiblemente la MEJOR trilogía de todos los tiempos!	1
Kieslowski nunca deja de sorprenderme.	1
Es uno de mis directores favoritos y uno de los directores más talentosos de la historia del cine.	1
Su uso de los colores de la bandera francesa en las tres películas fue increíble, cada toma, cada escena fue como una obra de arte.	1
Tres de las películas visualmente más atractivas que he visto.	1
Y sus conexiones sutiles entre las tres películas son impresionantes.	1
Tengo que mencionar esto y es un gran SPOILER, me encantó el final, cómo todos los personajes de las tres películas fueron los sobrevivientes restantes del desastre del ferry, con Valentine y el joven juez juntos, y el viejo mirándolo en ella. TV, solidificando su felicidad por el sufrimiento con el que lidió durante tantos años.	1
No podría pensar en una mejor manera de terminar la película, sino en una sonrisa en mi rostro, ¡una excelente manera de concluir una película y una trilogía increíbles!	1
Se lo recomiendo a TODOS los que aman el cine, las películas, cualquier cosa ... ¡Una obra de arte!	1
10 de 10 para la película y la trilogía.	1
Literalmente vomité mientras veía esta película.	0
Creo que fui una de las personas que encontró esta otra de las perlas de Roth.	1
Su actuación, tal como fue premiada, fue impresionante.	1
La historia contada tan elocuentemente por Francis Ford Coppola 25 años antes, realmente se desarrolla gradualmente y deja espacio para que los personajes se desarrollen.	1
En un lugar maravilloso se encuentra una historia de contraste.	1
En resumen, una hermosa película dirigida por Roeg de Nicola con un elenco sublime.	1
Estoy traduciendo películas para vivir y esta es la primera película en mi experiencia laboral de 5 años que encontré ofensiva para mi inteligencia.	0
Pero cuando alguien se esfuerza por la grandeza y la poesía, pero presenta una historia confusa (y a menudo ridícula), un montón de escenas dispares, diálogos pretenciosos ... Entonces obtienes el peor tipo de película que otro crítico definió con mucha precisión como &quot;pretencioso mierda&quot;.	0
Para aquellos que encuentran esta película inteligente o incluso magistral, solo puedo decir: es su inteligencia y su imaginación que obviamente solían tratar de darle sentido a este lamentable intento (está en nuestra naturaleza humana tratar de darle sentido a las cosas).	0
Una cosa más: puedo tolerar la incorrección política muy bien, estoy totalmente a favor de la libertad artística y la suspensión de la incredulidad, pero el personaje femenino eslavo era demasiado.	0
Esta es una película tan divertida y divertida.	1
Muy entretenido en todos los ángulos.	1
Cuenta con una variedad extravagante de nueces memorables, psicóticas pero adorables.	1
Entonces, para nuestro disfrute, podemos verlos correr, jugar y ser peligrosos.	1
Incluso tiene sus dulces momentos.	1
El reparador de teléfonos fue muy divertido y sus reacciones ante el jefe loco y perverso fueron realmente genuinas.	1
Todos los personajes de esta película están tremendamente bien interpretados.	1
Y realmente los encontré divertidos.	1
Esta es realmente una película muy inteligente.	1
Hay un brillante giro final.	1
&quot; Me encanta.	1
El final es tan, tan perfecto ... derramarás una lágrima.	1
Estoy tan emocionado después de ver una película como esta.	1
Nunca lo olvidaré ahora.	1
No es solo un culto ... es un culto CLÁSICO.	1
Que tiene más profundidad y carácter que el hombre debajo de él.	0
La configuración de Malta es tan seca y árida como el diálogo.	0
Esta pelicula es terrible.	0
Las escenas de hockey son terribles, los defensores juegan como si tuvieran 5 años, los porteros se zambullen en tiros que miden 10 pies de ancho de la red, etc.	0
Para aquellos que no lo han visto, ¡no pierdan su tiempo!	0
¡Llamar a esta película un drama es ridículo!	0
Comencé a ver esto pero no creía en ninguno de los personajes.	0
En particular, la relación entre el asistente de panadería y la camarera simplemente no funcionó para mí en absoluto.	0
Fue una película muy superficial y me dio la sensación de que estaba viendo una obra en lugar de una película.	0
Los personajes eran muy &quot;escénicos&quot; y la historia se parecía mucho a una farsa escénica.	0
Cuando el pirómano atacó al asistente, estaba aburrido y no me importó lo que sucedió después, así que lo desconecté.	0
Me alegro de no haber pagado para verlo.	0
No me reí ni sonreí ni una vez.	0
Pero no fue nada más que un gran bostezo ...	0
Es un muy buen espectáculo para ver.	1
Es muy educativo para niños de 1 a 8 años.	1
Barney es definitivamente súper DE duper.	1
es muy gracioso	1
Babie Bop es muy linda.	1
Los niños también son geniales.	1
&quot;Pero&quot; Storm Trooper &quot;ni siquiera es lo suficientemente malo como para llegar a la lista de películas maravillosamente terribles.	0
Es solo cojo.	0
El tipo que dijo que había tenido un mejor diálogo con sus plantas en maceta tiene razón.	0
Todo sobre esta película es estúpido.	0
Incluso si amas las malas películas, no mires esta película.	0
Es vergonzoso	0
Le daría a esta serie de televisión un 10 más si pudiera.	1
Los escritores estaban &quot;pegados&quot; y creo que los mejores actores y actrices fueron una ventaja para el espectáculo. Estos personajes fueron muy reales.	1
Debo decir que he grabado la mayoría de los episodios y me encuentro mirándolos una y otra vez.	1
¡Ahora sabes por qué le di un 10+!	1
No sé exactamente de qué se trata esta película, pero nos aferramos a esta película entrañable y se ha convertido en una parte especial de los recuerdos de nuestra familia.	1
Recomiendo total y absolutamente esta película a cualquiera a quien le gusten las buenas películas familiares sanas porque eso es exactamente lo que es.	1
Las cosas en las que se metieron los cuatro niños es absolutamente divertido de ver.	1
Esta es una de las mejores películas que muestra un vínculo de hermanos tan fuerte entre sí.	1
Mucho más interesante, más acción, más suspenso y menos controversia innecesaria.	1
Todo, desde la actuación hasta la cinematografía, fue sólido.	1
Definitivamente vale la pena echarle un vistazo.	1
Damian es tan talentoso y versátil en muchas formas de escribir y retratar diferentes personajes en la pantalla.	1
Esta película tiene una vanguardia.	1
Estoy muy contento de saber que existe un genio tan moderno, dejar que la pasión por el arte lo conduzca y llevarnos como audiencia con él.	1
Los nuevos personajes no fueron tan memorables, y me encontré olvidando quién era quién.	0
Sentí que ir a Irlanda no hizo absolutamente nada.	0
No me asustó, horrorizó ni simpatizó con los personajes; fue simplemente molesto.	0
Los movimientos bruscos de la cámara también eran molestos.	0
La trama era la misma que casi cualquier otro horror barato.	0
Hubo algunos intentos patéticos de darles profundidad a los personajes, pero realmente no funcionó en el resto de la trama.	0
Supongo que se suponía que era un giro inteligente, luego arrojó algo de luz sobre la situación, pero fue simplemente estúpido.	0
Si lo ve, probablemente debería dejarlo en el estante.	0
Elias Koteas, Jack Palance desempeñan buenos papeles Angelina es sexy y se desnuda. Billy Drago aparece en esto y es genial como siempre + un cameo de Sven ole Thorsen ayuda a hacer de esta una película muy agradable con buena actuación y un presupuesto decente.	1
Esta fue una película tan increíble que la compré en Ebay.	1
Realmente me encantó la historia y el oso polar era un poco lindo, pero si alguien tiene una pregunta sobre Fort Steele, solo pregunta :)	1
Esta película totalmente desagradable es tan exagerada, patética y poco realista que a lo largo de los 90 minutos de tortura total, ¡probablemente miré mi reloj unas 70000 veces!	0
Lucy Bell es mucho más alta que esta basura y para ella hundirse tan bajo es bastante deprimente.	0
Todo lo que esta película hace es enfermarte viendo a todos estos holgazanes poner excusas por sus estúpidas acciones durante 90 minutos.	0
¡Dios, y nunca puedo recuperar esos 90 minutos!	0
Creo que las partes más maravillosas (literalmente, llenas de &quot;maravillas&quot;) son los extractos de sus obras.	1
Los sets (especialmente diseñados para trabajar con la cámara) son increíbles ... estilizados, hermosos y efectivos.	1
Podrían usarse como ejemplos para cualquier escenógrafo.	1
Las historias fueron exploraciones poderosas de la naturaleza del hombre y del arte.	1
Después de ver esta película, quería aprender más sobre las obras de este artista.	1
Recomiendo esta película a cualquier persona interesada en el arte, la poesía, el teatro, la política o la historia japonesa.	1
Aquí, en El viento y el león, vemos una representación maravillosa de la era imperial de Estados Unidos.	1
Lo que hace que esta historia sea diferente son los excelentes valores de producción: fotografía impecable, composición y edición, el fantástico reparto, el poco apreciado Brian Keith interpretando a un matón Teddy, y la vívida historia.	1
Aunque The Wind and the Lion se cuenta en gran parte a través de los ojos del hijo, cada miembro de la familia puede identificarse con uno de los personajes, ya sea el noble bandolero de Sean Connery, la luchadora heroína de Candace Bergen, el astuto John John de John Huston o el de Steve Kanaly. teniente, radiante y despiadado, el &quot;Big Stick&quot; de Roosevelt.	1
Esta es una gran aventura en su mejor momento.	1
Creo que fue la mejor película de Robert Ryans, porque retrató a alguien como mi padre, y era un esquizofrénico en la vida real, (mi padre) aunque nunca asesinó a nadie, pero se vio afectado más durante la segunda guerra mundial que lo hizo peor.	1
Tener que seguirle el humor para pasar el día era muy adecuado.	1
(Mi madre y mi hermano tuvieron que hacer esto) Cuando vi a Robert Ryan retratar a este tipo de hombre, fue una muy buena imitación de este tipo de persona, y me impresionó.	1
Casi todas las canciones de Cover Girl son anticuadas y no muy afinadas.	0
Lo más molesto de &#39;Cover Girl&#39; es la forma en que Rita Hayworth se coloca en un pedestal.	0
Desafortunadamente, &#39;Cover Girl&#39; es un ejemplo de cómo Hollywood solía explotar a las mujeres para obtener ganancias financieras.	0
La narración no lineal, por lo tanto, muchos flashbacks y cada parte se articulan bastante bien.	1
La buena cinematografía también hace que ella y Monica Bellucci se vean muy hermosas.	1
Un buen comentario del amor de hoy y, sin duda, una película que vale la pena ver.	1
Para las personas que son novatas en la realización de películas, ¡creo que hicieron un excelente trabajo!	1
Fue muy popular cuando estaba en el cine, una buena casa y muy buenas reacciones y muchas risas.	1
¡Es una película para sentirse bien y así me sentí cuando salí del cine!	1
Tiene humor norteño y positivo sobre la comunidad que representa.	1
Lo disfruté bastante.	1
Me gustó.	1
No podría tomarlos en serio.	0
Sin embargo, realmente creó una sensación única.	1
Vivian Schilling hizo un excelente trabajo con el guión.	1
Un mundo mejor que el 95% de la basura en los teatros de hoy.	1
Su papel se jugó bien.	1
No demasiado gritón, no a lo masculino, sino justo.	1
La cámara realmente le gusta en esta película.	1
La habría elegido para ese papel después de haber preparado el guión.	1
Como europeo, la película es un buen recuerdo de mi tiempo como estudiante en la década de 1980 y las experiencias que tuve viviendo en el extranjero e interactuando con otras nacionalidades, aunque las circunstancias fueron ligeramente diferentes.	1
Soy fanático de su ... Esta película apestaba muy mal.	0
¡Incluso peor que Ticker!	0
Y esa película fue mala.	0
Solo como 3 o 4 edificios usados, un par de ubicaciones PUEDEN, y ¡hummh pobre!	0
Simplemente explotó.	0
¡Esta película es excelente! ¡Angel es hermoso y Scamp es adorable! Sus pequeños gritos cuando está asustado, y las partes más divertidas son cuando: Scamp queda atrapado debajo de la cortina y cuando Angel y Scamp cantan &#39;Ive Never Had This Feeling Before&#39;. Recomiendo totalmente esta película, que saldrá en edición especial el 20 de junio. La portada tiene un bote de basura y Angel debajo de la tapa.	1
No puedo explicar esta película más que romántica, encantadora, hilarante y adorable. Las escenas de chatarrería son divertidas, todos los perros de chatarra tienen algo especial. Demasiado gracioso, me reí, a los niños les ENCANTARÁ. Cuando salga, tiene ¡nuevas características!	1
Ahora fuimos elegidos para ser torturados con esta repugnante propaganda americana descarada.	0
Este espectáculo está hecho para estadounidenses: es demasiado estúpido y lleno de odio y clichés para ser admitido en otro lugar.	0
Casi todos los involucrados deben regresar a la escuela, la actuación es absolutamente predecible y mala, el guión es un montón de basura.	0
¿Me gustaría poder ingresar valores negativos, administradores?	0
Los sets son tan malos que no se verían fuera de lugar en un episodio de Thunderbirds.	0
El uso de la cámara lenta se repite innecesariamente a lo largo de la película, pero está bien respaldado por la mala actuación (y mal es una palabra amable aquí), sin continuidad, escenas que se lanzan sin razón alguna, vehículos que parecían hechos. de una caja de Corn Flakes y un estilo de director que rayaba en la estupidez.	0
Ah sí, y la historia también fue patética.	0
Odio escribir malas críticas sobre películas, especialmente aquellas en las que realmente me gusta la estrella, pero esta película es tan mala que no creo ni por un segundo que alguien pueda estar orgulloso de ella.	0
No soy cineasta ni director, pero escondería mi cabeza en la arena si hubiera gastado la cantidad de dinero y tiempo en esta película.	0
En resumen, esta fue una pérdida monumental de tiempo y energía y no recomendaría a nadie que alguna vez vea esta película.	0
Fue gratis con un reproductor de DVD que compré, pero todavía lo apagué a la mitad porque estaba avergonzado por Howell.	0
1/10 - y solo porque no hay ajustes para 0/10.	0
Una premisa interesante, y Billy Drago siempre es bueno como un loco loco (nota al margen: me encantaría ver a Drago, Stephen McHattie y Lance Hendrikson en una película juntos; ¡habla sobre pómulos furiosos!).	1
La banda sonora tampoco fue terrible.	1
Pero la actuación, incluso la de profesionales como Drago y Debbie Rochon, fue terrible, la dirección peor (quizás contribuyente a la primera), el diálogo como un chimpancé y el trabajo de la cámara, apenas tolerable.	0
Aún así, fueron los SETS los que obtuvieron un gran &quot;10&quot; en mi escala &quot;oy-vey&quot;.	1
Sí, estoy simplificando las cosas aquí en aras de la brevedad, ya que esto realmente es el núcleo de los problemas con esta película: tiene demasiadas cosas sin una explicación real y satisfactoria.	0
Ambos hacen buenos trabajos y son bastante divertidos.	1
Pero la intrincada trama simplemente no me convenció, y gran parte de la película fue vista con una mirada extraña e inquisitiva.	0
Dejé que mi novia me convenciera de ver esto; mala idea, los dos lo odiamos.	0
Los últimos 15 minutos de película tampoco son malos.	1
Bela Lugosi era totalmente extraña, entonando líneas extrañas.	0
La actuación fue decididamente de madera, aunque no peor que una película de época de Universal B.	0
Me gusta Armand Assante y el resumen de mi compañía de cable sonaba interesante, así que lo vi dos veces y probablemente lo vuelva a ver.	1
Creo que el guionista hizo un buen trabajo al atar los cabos sueltos.	1
Mi puntaje de 8/10 es principalmente para la trama.	1
No diré nada más: no me gustan los spoilers, así que no quiero ser uno, pero creo que esta película vale la pena.	1
Wow, que mala película.	0
No asusta en lo más mínimo, y apenas comprensible.	0
La trama no se mantiene unida, y la actuación es absolutamente espantosa.	0
¡Ni siquiera es bueno para el valor del campamento!	0
No esperaba material de Oscar, pero ¿esto?	0
Tendrías que tener el coeficiente intelectual de un molusco particularmente estúpido para no ver venir ese.	0
Esta película (y uso esa palabra libremente) es un insulto para el público que va al cine.	0
¡Ojalá alguien involucrado en él supiera cómo encadenar la narrativa!	0
Esto obtiene un 1 de 10, simplemente porque no hay nada más bajo.	0
Este es uno que no tenía, pero lo vi recientemente en Fox Movie Channel y quedé muy decepcionado.	0
Sé que era un jugador por contrato con poco control sobre sus guiones, pero la actuación fue tan mala como el guión.	0
Victor McLaglen era incluso malo, y Brian DonLevy era casi irreconocible.	0
Teniendo en cuenta las relaciones fuera de pantalla entre Taylor y Stanwyck, fue sorprendente la poca química que había en pantalla entre los dos.	0
Pero la premisa de la película era tan ridícula: que el presidente de los Estados Unidos	0
Las escenas del corredor de la muerte eran completamente inmóviles.	0
Lo único peor que la actuación de Taylor fue el canto de Stanwyck.	0
Lo que sea que buscara el productor, se lo perdió por completo.	0
Estaba profundamente impresionado con el personaje que interpretaba.	1
Cuando vi la película, supe que este actor talentoso vendría más cosas geniales.	1
Una película de atracos barata y desalentadora con una caracterización deficiente, muchos emoticones estoicos de estilo mordido (piense en Chow Yun Fat en A Better Tomorrow) y algunos clichés cursi arrojados a una fábrica abandonada listos para unos pocos rollos de judo volador mal ejecutados a la manera de John Woo.	0
Incluso los squibs se ven horribles.	0
En ningún momento del proceso se parece remotamente a Estados Unidos.	0
La trama, tal como es, es tan derivada y predecible que el final es como un asesinato por piedad.	0
El horrible diálogo y la desesperada sobreactuación de todos los que reciben un disparo son una verdadera pérdida de espacio y tiempo.	0
Estaba muy incómodo con lo mala que era esta película, pero no tenía miedo en absoluto.	0
El diálogo se compone de cosas que tienen poco sentido.	0
Se desperdician unos 30 minutos de material de archivo para mostrar a los actores mayores mediocres balbuceando torpemente sedoso y gibberish lo suficientemente cursi lo suficiente como para hacer que un adolescente gótico se sonroje, casi siempre en inglés antiguo y, a veces, en latín que pueden o no ser palabras inventadas.	0
La dirección es descuidada en el mejor de los casos.	0
Escritura trillada, sin duda, pero empeoró aún más por la mala dirección.	0
Por supuesto, la actuación es bla.	0
La actuación de todo el elenco podría ponerse en una escala y equilibrarse perfectamente entre sobreactuar y no interactuar.	0
Y, FINALMENTE, después de todo eso, llegamos a un final que hubiera sido excelente si hubiera sido manejado por personas competentes y no por Jerry Falwell.	0
Me encantó esta película, era una gran representación de una familia que tenía sus altibajos, pero al final sabían que se amaban especialmente el uno al otro.	1
He visto muchas películas protagonizadas por Jaclyn Smith, pero Dios mío, esta fue una de sus mejores, aunque salió hace 12 años.	1
Esta película contenía un elenco de estrellas, y lo que más me gustó fue que me abrió los ojos para ver a otros actores que no había visto antes.	1
Esta película fue bastante larga, pero disfruté cada minuto.	1
En general, califico esta película como 10 de una escala de 1-10.	1
Lifetime no lo transmite lo suficiente, por lo que si alguien sabe qué tienda vende, avíseme porque es imprescindible.	1
Recuerdo particularmente que mis sentidos fueron asaltados por cuerdas estridentes de música que sonarían con muy poca advertencia, y aún menos significado.	0
Es el tipo de papilla que se examina por la tarde para castigar a los desempleados por no tener trabajo.	0
Totalmente diferente, con mucha subestimación y comedia negra, esta es una película que pocos pueden ver, pero aquellos que lo hagan lo recordarán.	1
Esta película crea su propio universo y es fascinante en todos los sentidos.	1
Pero esta película realmente me atrapó.	1
Míralo.	1
Realmente espero que el equipo detrás de esta película haga más películas, y que continúen haciéndolo en su propio estilo, algo extraño.	1
Y olvidé: El casting aquí es excelente, con Trond Fausa Aurvåg siendo perfecto en el papel de Hombre molesto, que no entiende dónde está, qué está haciendo y por qué.	1
Esta película es un comentario bueno y humorístico sobre la vida en 2006.	1
Encontré este movimiento hermoso, agradable y estimulante.	1
Inicialmente, los sitios locales en la película, que fue filmada aquí en Buffalo, me intrigaron.	1
Más tarde me encontré perdido en el poder de la película.	1
Toda la audiencia aplaudió al final de la película.	1
Salí del teatro con una inclinación en mi paso, alegría en mi corazón y esperanza para la raza humana.	1
Duris tiene una apariencia saludable y ofrece un excelente rendimiento.	1
El resto del elenco también juega bien.	1
Cabe destacar la cinematografía, que incluye hermosas vistas de Barcelona y sus famosas torres de Gaudí.	1
Unos diez minutos después de esta película comencé a tener dudas.	0
Alrededor de la mitad de esta película, comencé a no gustarme.	0
Cuando terminó la película, no solo no me gustaba, sino que la despreciaba.	0
Lo que le falta a esta película es un guión convincente.	0
El guión parece que solo se escribió un borrador y el rodaje comenzó antes de que se completara un guión terminado.	0
Las cosas suceden, las personalidades de los personajes cambian, los giros de la trama ocurren sin ninguna razón real aparte de que el guión lo requiere.	0
El reparto es bueno.	1
Por eso, vale la pena echarle un vistazo.	1
Este es probablemente el espectáculo más irritante que he visto en toda mi vida.	0
Es indescriptiblemente el espectáculo más molesto e idiota que he visto.	0
Todo al respecto es simplemente malo.	0
No podía entender, qué tipo de idiota produciría este desastre en primer lugar, sin mencionar varias temporadas.	0
El guión es malo, muy malo: contiene tanto bromas como bromas poco éticas que normalmente se ven en las películas clasificadas R o NC-17.	0
El casting también es horrible, porque todo lo que ves es un actor realmente muy malo, punto.	0
Palabra final: ¡Este espectáculo es una verdadera tortura!	0
Está a millones de veces de la realidad.	0
Ver la lavadora girando no dañaría tus ojos tanto como este espectáculo.	0
Calificación: 0/10 (Grado: Z) Nota: El show es tan malo que incluso la madre del elenco saca a su hija del show.	0
ROAD HOUSE de 20th Century Fox (1948) no solo es un negro tonto, sino que es un aburrimiento implacable de una película.	0
Lleno de personajes de cartón poco convincentes, está escrito con suavidad por Edward Chodorov, quien también produjo, y sorprendentemente dirigido por Jean Negulesco, de quien uno esperaría mucho más.	0
¡A partir de aquí, el personaje de Widmark se vuelve involuntariamente cómico!	0
Perder sus canicas tan temprano en el proceso es totalmente inverosímil y poco convincente.	0
Y si eso no es un desastre de película, la imagen también se ve empañada por el uso constante de decorados de estudio y exteriores interiores.	0
¡Todo lo que provocó tal documental está más allá de mí!	0
(spoilers muy serios) esta película fue una gran decepción.	0
Hay tantos problemas que no sé por dónde empezar.	0
El elenco fue genial.	1
steve martin ofrece una actuación realmente divertida de un hombre blanco de mediana edad, clase alta y tenso.	1
agregue Betty White y Jean Smart y tendrá un gran elenco: todos jugaron sus papeles muy bien.	1
Pero la película comete muchos errores graves.	0
En primer lugar, hay suficientes estereotipos raciales y chistes raciales para ofender a todos.	0
la película está llena de insultos raciales abiertos hacia los miembros negros del reparto y, a cambio, los blancos se representan como imbéciles y pechos.	0
Dejando a un lado la carta de carrera, veamos la falla principal en la película: destruyen el personaje de Latifa.	0
No hay una trama real.	0
No volvería a ver esta película gratis.	0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE es una película increíblemente importante para nuestra historia del cine.	1
Esta segunda aparición de Mickey Mouse (después del silencioso PLANE CRAZY a principios de ese año) es probablemente su película más famosa, principalmente porque fue muy innovadora.	1
Si bien aún no escuchas a Mickey hablar, hay toneladas de efectos de sonido y música a lo largo de la película, algo que damos por sentado ahora, pero que fue un gran placer para la multitud en 1928.	1
Sin embargo, después de ver el corto nuevamente después de unos 25 años, me sorprendió lo atemporal que es la película.	1
Es adorable ver a Mickey interpretar &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; de una manera muy imaginativa (aunque a veces cruel).	1
Inteligente y realmente complaciente: esta película todavía se encuentra entre las mejores películas de Mickey incluso después de 80 años maravillosos.	1
La bipolaridad del matón despiadado (un minuto un asesino despiadado, el siguiente minuto un comercial de pañales de Luv) es completamente poco convincente.	0
Estoy terriblemente decepcionado de que esta película reciba tantos premios y reconocimientos, especialmente cuando hay obras de cine mucho más merecedoras.	0
El original Body and Soul (1947) es una obra maestra.	1
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... y fueron filmados por uno de los mejores cineastas que jamás hayan aparecido en la pantalla ... James Wong Howe.	1
No creo que haya cualidades redentoras en esta nueva versión.	0
Esta puede ser la única película mala que haya hecho.	0
Tan malo ... bueno ... es malo.	0
Esta película es un ejemplo sólido de una mala trama y una muy, muy mala idea en todo momento.	0
Es una pena ver a buenos actores como Thomerson y James ganarse la vida en un lío como este.	0
Pensé que era malo	0
Ambas películas son terribles, pero para el crédito de la versión de 1986, se podía ver.	0
Comencemos con todos los problemas: la actuación, especialmente del profesor principal, fue muy, muy mala.	0
El guión es un gran desastre defectuoso.	0
El mejor ejemplo de cuán tonta es la escritura cuando se establece que puedes volver a convertir a los estudiantes zombis en humanos quitando un collar que contiene una pieza del meteorito.	0
El director Paul Matthews, quien también escribió / dirigió la débil película de monstruos de 1995 &quot;Grim&quot;, claramente no sabe cómo controlar sus películas.	0
La película es terriblemente aburrida en algunos lugares.	0
La iluminación es horrible.	0
La película se ve barata y sosa.	0
Uno de los aspectos más decepcionantes es la falta de sangre notable.	0
Esta convención nunca funcionó bien en el pasado, y ciertamente no funciona aquí.	0
Los efectos visuales fueron HORRIBLES.	0
¡La secuencia de apertura de CG en el espacio parecía que podría haberse creado en Microsoft Slideshow por el amor de Dios!	0
La &quot;explosión&quot; de los tanques de gas al final fue igual de horrible.	0
De acuerdo, me gusta considerarme un crítico justo, así que daré crédito donde sea debido: los efectos de la criatura fueron realmente geniales.	1
¡Tengo que amar esos primeros planos de dientes viscosos y babeantes!	1
Para resumir la película, &quot;Breeders&quot; es una película de terror terrible y barata que debe evitarse como el virus del Ébola.	0
No recomendado.	0
Es casi insoportable verlo en la pantalla, tiene poco o ningún carisma y un terrible momento cómico.	0
Además de su terrible plomo, esta película tiene muchos otros débitos.	0
Entiendo que se supone que es una comedia barata de palomitas de maíz, pero eso no significa que tenga que insultar por completo nuestra inteligencia, y tener una escritura tan increíblemente trillada que raya en la ofensiva.	0
El considerable talento de Lewis Black también se desperdicia aquí, ya que está en su punto más incendiario cuando no tiene restricciones, lo que la clasificación PG-13 ciertamente no permitirá.	0
El único punto brillante de la película fue Jonah Hill (que se verá casi irreconocible para los fanáticos de la reciente Superbad debido a la cantidad de peso que perdió en el ínterin).	1
Con la originalidad y frescura de la primera película que se pasó ahora, esta nueva versión tenía poco más que ofrecer.	0
El presupuesto era evidentemente muy limitado.	0
Esto se reflejó no solo en el elenco, sino también en el guión por debajo del par, que tomó prestado mucho del clásico anterior.	0
Sin embargo, aquí no hubo trabajo decente de actuación, acción o ubicación para equilibrar las cosas.	0
Filmiing fue menos expansivo.	0
No logró transmitir la amplia extensión de paisajes que eran una gran parte del original.	0
Generalmente; simplemente le faltaba imaginación.	0

¿Es posible que una película empeore?	0
No hay una trama aquí para mantenerte en primer lugar.	0
Incluso cuando las mujeres finalmente aparecen, no hay signos de mejoría; suceden las cosas más esperadas y para cuando termine la película, es posible que estés muy dormido.	0
Cuidado: esta no es una película de culto basura, ¡es un período de basura!	0
¡No puedo creer que haya una secuela de esto!	0
¡Por eso precisamente le estoy dando una crítica tan mala!	0
Siendo un niño de los 90, realmente disfruté este espectáculo y puedo decir con orgullo que lo disfruté a lo grande e incluso más que las caricaturas clásicas de WB.	1
Pero &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; mantuvo el ambiente de los 90 y entregó una de las caricaturas más populares, divertidas y subestimadas jamás creadas.	1
Los recuerdos son turbios, pero solo puedo decir que disfruté de cada episodio y producto relacionado con el programa.	1
Fácilmente, ninguna otra caricatura me hizo reír de una manera tierna (antes de entrar en comedias oscuras orientadas para adolescentes).	1
Todos los personajes eran divertidos y tenían la peculiaridad de no tener un verdadero personaje principal.	1
Cada personaje era hilarante y merecía ser llamado protagonista.	1
Cada elemento de esta historia fue tan exagerado, excesivamente falso y artificial que fue doloroso sentarse.	0
Sus líneas parecen haber sido ESCRITAS por un chico de quince años, aunque están intentando, oh, tan difícil parecer como un chico de quince años realmente, um, ya sabes, bueno ... hablar.	0
Perabo tiene un buen nivel de energía y obviamente es muy cómodo frente a una cámara.	1
Simplemente no hay excusa para algo tan mal hecho.	0
Vi esta película y pensé que es una película estúpida.	0
Lo que es aún más estúpido es que ¿quién pensó la idea de que debería haber un volcán en Los Ángeles?	0
Para ser honesto contigo, esto es una tontería increíble y muy tonto.	0
En conclusión, no me molestaré con esta película porque un volcán en Los Ángeles no es más que una tontería.	0
¡La historia es simplemente horrible!	0
¡Es simplemente doloroso!	0
¡Y los acentos son absolutamente abismales!	0
También hay suficiente hipocresía en esta película para hacerme vomitar.	0
No pierdas tu tiempo viendo esta película de basura no investigada.	0
Creo que Pitch Black se hizo bien.	1
Los personajes son interesantes y quieres saber más sobre ellos cuanto más dure la película, y creo que la gente se sorprenderá de quién lo hace y quién no.	1
Ve a verlo!	1

¡Muy divertido!	1
Mi calificación: solo 3 de 10.	0
Los personajes son interesantes y realmente te importan.	1
Un clásico instantáneo, con una gran banda sonora y una canción pegadiza durante los créditos finales.	1

Esta es una obra maestra de la realización de películas, con muchos temas a fuego lento y ocasionalmente hirviendo en estas verrugas y todo el estudio de los años de guerra bohemios y autocomplacientes del poeta que abarcan los bombardeos aéreos de Londres y la tranquilidad exterior de un refugio costero galés. - las fronteras entre amistad, lujuria y amor, dedicación al arte y la experiencia versus preocupaciones prácticas, celos, rivalidad, cobardía y egoísmo versus heroísmo y sacrificio personal y más.	1
Un guión sutil y maduro que sugiere y ocasionalmente enfatiza dramáticamente las tensiones subyacentes está bien servido por actuaciones perfectas (aparte de la extraña sonrisa inapropiada a la que es propenso Keira Knightley, aunque quizás esta vez bajo dirección, ya que los otros personajes a menudo lo mencionan) )	1
Pero, sobre todo, la exquisita composición visual de cada momento, con el uso ingenioso y elegante del primer plano, el ángulo de la cámara y la iluminación, incluidas las imágenes puntillistas de películas caseras falsas, es una maravilla y una alegría para la vista.	1
Es tan bello como un Bertolucci, pero las relaciones aquí son más convincentes y la narrativa más atractiva que parte del trabajo de ese maestro.	1
La premisa básica se desperdicia, ya que queda al margen por el inexplicable enfoque en el equipo documental.	0
De todos modos, la película falla en la mayoría de los niveles.	0
Evitar a toda costa.	0
Vi esta película en Navidad, ¡y qué gran película fue!	1
¡Pensé que Errol Flynn era brillante como Custer y desde entonces se ha convertido en mi actor favorito!	1
¡Su actuación junto a Olivia De Havilland fue brillante y el final fue fantástico!	1
Siempre supe que Errol Flynn era un actor brillante, ya que era el actor favorito de mi padre, y crecí viendo sus películas cuando era niño.	1
Pero no fue hasta que vi esta película que me di cuenta de lo genial que era en realidad.	1
¡Le daré a esta película 10 de 10!	1
Sé que Jim O&#39;Connor era muy enérgico y que nadie podía ser tanto como él, pero George era muy aburrido.	0
Realmente no parecía querer ser el anfitrión; sus voces en off eran monótonas, no se involucraron con los invitados.	0
Pequeño y encantador thriller de Hitchcock, con muchas travesuras agradables que rodean a un espía asesinado, un niño secuestrado, una iglesia desagradable, un complot extranjero y algunos taxidermistas al azar.	1
Jimmy Stewart es como siempre un gran héroe para Hitchcock, la historia llega a su clímax en una función de embajada, pero carece de la amenaza amenazante del original en blanco y negro de bajo presupuesto de Hitchcock.	1
Sin embargo, otra película maravillosa del establo del gran maestro.	1
¡Debo decir que esta película fue excelentemente producida y encabeza las clasificaciones como una película de ciencia ficción típica!	1
¡Excelentemente producido por uno de los mejores productores de ciencia ficción, Scot Vandiver!	1
Pero es entretenido, no obstante.	1
Es una película cursi que es una alegría ver.	1
Apenas hay un momento aburrido en la película y hay muchas partes humorísticas.	1
El reparto siempre es entretenido como siempre.	1
En general, una delicia!	1
Esta película es tan increíblemente horrible que ni siquiera podría haber sido creada.	0
La película carece de temores o tensiones reales y parte de la terminología médica utilizada es un poco dudosa por decir lo menos y lo digo como diabético dependiente de insulina.	0
Cuanto menos se diga sobre la actuación, mejor.	0
Esta película hace un excelente trabajo al revelar la complejidad de la tarea y los increíbles desafíos que enfrenta Sudáfrica.	1
Creo que todos deberían ver esta película, ya que creo que pocas personas fuera de Sudáfrica entienden su pasado y lo que se está intentando en el proceso de Verdad y Reconciliación.	1
Nada menos que una magnífica fotografía / cinematografía en esta película.	1
La actuación es fantástica, las historias están entretejidas y los perros son espléndidos ... Imprescindible alquilar, ver o ver.	1
No tengas miedo de los subtítulos ........ vale la pena un poco de terapia de aversión 10/10	1
Excelente actuación.	1
¡Todavía hay buenos actores alrededor!	1
También excelente dirección y fotografía.	1
Muy fiel a Shakespear, y un &#39;must&#39; para todos los fanáticos de Shakespear.	1
Macbeth (Jason Connery) me conmovió hasta las lágrimas con su monólogo final (fuera de breve vela, fuera) Le dio a la esfera de la decadencia moral y las fuerzas oscuras un rostro humano, lo que lo hace más interesante.	1
Helen Baxendale es una señora Macbeth muy creíble que a veces puede ser muy alegre y, a veces, parece una niña traviesa, pero mortal en su gusto por la sangre y el mal.	1
Si amas la muerte y la decadencia, y las letras de Shakespears ... este es el indicado.	1
Esta es una adaptación ingeniosa y deliciosa del libro del Dr. Seuss, brillantemente animada por el mejor y completamente merecedor de su Premio de la Academia de la UPA.	1
Debe hacerse una mención especial a la excelente partitura musical y los efectos de sonido, que son un elemento integral para ayudar a hacer de esta una caricatura tan memorable y agradable.	1
Sin embargo, Paul Schrader ha hecho una película &quot;sobre&quot; Mishima que es excelente y compleja.	1
También es notable la fina y crujiente cinematografía de John Bailey, y el gran diseño de producción y vestuario de Eiko Ishioka, quien realizó los disfraces memorables para Drácula de Coppola por la que recibió un merecido Oscar.	1
Incluso teniendo en cuenta los bajos valores de producción para la época (1971) y el formato (algún tipo de miniserie), esto es baaaaaad.	0
A menos que esté solo para &quot;recopilar&quot; visualmente todas las películas existentes del trabajo de Austen, puede omitir esta.	0
Sin embargo, si lo ves, hay pequeños consuelos: las actrices que interpretan a las hermanas de Anne hacen un trabajo maravilloso con sus papeles.	1
No es bueno.	0
Hablando de la música, es insoportablemente predecible y kitsch.	0
Entonces la película acaba de dejar caer la pelota.	0
Esta es una película deslumbrante.	1
Crudo y sublimemente conmovedor.	1
Se sintió como una obra teatral inteligente muy apasionante (pero sin la sensación demasiado teatral que uno realmente siente al mirar a la gente en un escenario) que juega con el terror de todos de una mentira blanca que se eleva a consecuencias monstruosas.	1
Todos los jugadores principales son fascinantes.	1
Tom Wilkinson me rompió el corazón al final ... y todos los demás están juzgando por la cantidad de torpezas por pañuelos y manos que se enfrentan a hombres y mujeres por igual.	1
Julian Fellowes ha triunfado nuevamente.	1
Es un tesoro nacional.	1
¡VE Y VÉLO!	1
Esta es una película excelente.	1
Las escenas aéreas estaban bien hechas.	1
También era el equilibrio correcto de guerra y amor.	1
La película da sentido a la frase: &quot;Nunca en la historia de los conflictos humanos se le debe tanto a tan pocos.	1
Kris Kristoffersen es bueno en esta película y realmente marca la diferencia.	1
¡Una buena película de un gran director!	1
Este es definitivamente uno de los mejores documentales que he visto mirando las relaciones familiares y el matrimonio.	1
Hay muchos errores de continuidad: otro usuario comentó sobre diferentes autos en el garaje, las gafas de Joe ... el que más me llamó la atención fue el hecho de que la configuración del vello facial de Joe parecía cambiar de una escena a otra.	0
Esta es solo una gran película.	1
10 de 10 estrellas.	1
No puedo ver cómo esta película puede ser una inspiración para que alguien salga o supere el miedo y el rechazo.	0
Es tan malo que realmente vale la pena verlo solo por esa razón.	0

Uno de los peores espectáculos de todos los tiempos.	0
El espectáculo comenzaría con comentarios inteligentes entre ellos que estarían totalmente fuera de la pared y no serían necesarios.	0

Stanwyck y Morgan están perfectamente moldeados en lo que es, en muchos sentidos, un equivalente moderno del Cuento de Navidad de Dickens en su sensibilidad.	1
El éxito de la película depende del reparto de Sydney Greenstreet como el personaje de Alexander Yardley.	1
El atractivo conjunto utilizado en la mayor parte de la película es una joya agradable a la vista.	1

Acabo de ver esta película y la recomiendo.	1
Tiene una muy buena trama, mantiene su atención completa, la actuación es excelente, Tom Wilkinson fue fantástico y Emily Watson también fue muy buena.	1
Una muy buena película, sobre el amor grande e incondicional.	1
El personaje de Tom Wilkinson es un hombre que no está preparado para la prueba que está a punto de comenzar, pero toma el asunto en la mano a medida que avanza la historia, y este gran actor ofrece una actuación que te hace sentir la angustia y el sufrimiento del personaje.	1
El personaje de Emily Watson es muy fuerte, y solo tiene que dar un vistazo rápido y usted lo comprende todo.	1
A pesar de las críticas de los críticos, me gustó esta película.	1
De hecho, me gustó más que Entrevista con un vampiro y me gustó más este Lestat (Stuart Townsend) que el intento de Cruise.	1
Aailiyah era bastante buena como Akasha, en lugares convincentes (su primera entrada y mini escena de baile).	1
Soy un gran admirador de esta serie debido principalmente al estilo, las sensibilidades y los tratamientos de Anne Rice.	1
Supongo que me gustaron los detalles de su disfunción: era creíble.	1
Las escenas de fútbol al final fueron desconcertantes.	0
Pero pensé que su actuación era hábil.	1
Meredith M era mejor que bien.	1
Una película muy encantadora con un maravilloso sentimiento y corazón.	1
Es raro que un cineasta se tome el tiempo de contar una historia moral digna con cuidado y amor que no caiga en la trampa de ser demasiado almibarado o indulgente.	1
Nueve de cada diez para una película realmente encantadora.	1
Esta primera película del futuro goremeister Lucio Fulci es una muy buena adición al subgénero giallo.	1
Este es uno de los mejores thrillers italianos de principios de los 70.	1
Una escena destacada.	1
Esta escena es muy fuerte y desagradable.	0
Técnicamente, la película está bien hecha con un impresionante trabajo de cámara, una actuación sólida y música efectiva de Riz Ortolani, particularmente buena es una voz femenina recurrente no acompañada que suena como si viniera de una colina distante.	1
Sin embargo, todavía es algo salvaje y es muy recomendable para los fanáticos del cine giallo.	1
La película fue muy interesante de principio a fin.	1
Me gustó la forma en que el personaje de Dustin Hoffman estaba listo para hacer casi todo para quedarse con su hijo.	1
Esta película también es reveladora.	1
Personalmente, creo que muestra que las personas deberían aprender a encontrar un compromiso sin comprometer a otras personas.	1
Y fue aburrido.	0
Estoy tan cansado de los clichés que es solo una escritura perezosa, y aquí vienen gruesos y rápidos.	0
PD: la única escena en la película que fue genial es cuando el personaje central encuentra su habitación explotada.	1
Es un efecto fresco, sutil y bastante sublime.	1
Un crítico italiano lo llamó &quot;una película pequeña y excelente&quot;, y eso es correcto.	1
Todos los actores dan una actuación maravillosa, especialmente Jennifer Rubin como Jamie Harris, que cambia de la estrella nerviosa al principio a través de los extraños eventos de los que ella forma parte a la estrella genial.	1
Aprendes mucho sobre las verdaderas emociones internas de las personas en esta película, y mucho sobre el negocio del cine en sí.	1
La película en situaciones cinematográficas al principio y durante el juego que juega con ella el &quot;entrenador en funciones&quot; es fascinante.	1
Además, la música de Mark Snow es posiblemente la mejor partitura que he escuchado.	1
¡No olvidarás esta película!	1

Lo vi de niño en la televisión en 1973, cuando era &quot;The Stranger&quot; y me encantó.	1
Pero el dúo entre el astronauta y su médico al comienzo de la película es un intercambio perfecto si se considera que esta película se introdujo bien en la Guerra Fría y el mayor temor del astronauta es que se haya estrellado en la URSS.	1
¡Esta película es increíble!	1
Me encantó, fue realmente aterrador.	1
Me encantan las películas de Scream y todas las películas de terror, y esta está muy arriba.	1
¡Si quieres un verdadero susto alquila este!	1
10/10	1
Esta es una película extraordinaria.	1
Como drama de la corte, es convincente, como una acusación contra el sistema de justicia estadounidense, es aterrador.	1
Esta película resalta los defectos fundamentales del proceso legal, que no se trata de descubrir la culpabilidad o la inocencia, sino más bien de quién se presenta mejor en la corte.	1
La película tiene buen ritmo, es discreta y es uno de los mejores documentales de la corte que he visto.	1
Este drama televisivo basado en hechos, en su mayoría de rutina, recibe un impulso de la excelente actuación de Cole.	1
Previsible, pero no es un mal reloj.	1
Estaba claro que ella tenía el alcance y la capacidad de llevar a cabo esta parte.	1
Ella lleva bien la película.	1
Constantine le da a todo la intensidad adecuada y parece tener una buena comprensión de las motivaciones psicológicas subyacentes.	1
Es maravilloso e inspirador verlo, y espero que sea lanzado nuevamente en video o DVD.	1
La forma en que se lanzó este pedazo de basura está más allá de mí: la actuación, la historia, los personajes, los supuestos efectos especiales, etc. Todo está mal.	0
De hecho, este apestoso huele a un lanzamiento directo a video.	0
Evitar a toda costa!	0
Star Trek V La última frontera es la peor de la serie.	0
La actuación de todos los involucrados y que incluye a aquellos como Shatner y Nimoy es mala y desvaída y hace que parezcan tan viejos como se ven en la vida real, los efectos especiales son pegajosos como cuando Spock tiene que rescatar a Kirk en un jet pack cuando cae bajando de una montaña.	0
Los intentos de humor fueron lamentables y la historia es tan horrible que no hay que pensar en lo que básicamente involucra a un vulcano robando el Enterprise para encontrar a Dios (en serio) Simplemente no me importó nada de esta película y, por no mencionar que Uhura sí una danza del vientre para distraer a los guardias varones.	0
El único lugar bueno para esta película es en la basura.	0
El peor de la serie.	0
Edición: La edición de esta película fue fenomenal en mi opinión.	1
Cuando una canción podía explicar mejor las emociones de los sujetos, como cuando la desafortunada vida de Jay Adams era un tema de conversación, se tocaba la canción Old Man de Neil Young, que evoca muchas emociones.	1
Cinematografía: la película fue filmada de una manera interesante.	1
Por supuesto, las imágenes de los años 70 fueron granuladas, pero eso solo mejoró la película.	1
Esta película ofrece muchas delicias y sorpresas.	1
Cuando Achille y Philippa cantan bellamente un dúo de &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; que describe perfectamente su situación en la película, aprecian las capas sutiles de esta excelente película.	1
La historia se desarrolla en Jutlandia del siglo XVIII y el uso de música de época tocada en instrumentos de época es solo un toque más.	1
Compartes la exquisita alegría del general Loewenhielm al participar de Cailles en Sarcophage aunque solo estés viendo una película, pero deseas una pequeña muestra para saborear.	1
Pero esta película discreta deja una impresión duradera.	1
La calidez que genera contrasta con su austero telón de fondo.	1
Saldrás del teatro con ganas de salir a bailar bajo las estrellas.	1
La actuación, como es de esperar de este elenco, es de primera categoría.	1
Los personajes se desarrollan sorprendentemente bien, particularmente Grimes y Blake, y todos los actores entregan sus líneas marcadamente escritas con la cantidad justa de lengua inexpresiva en la mejilla para que el diálogo sea hilarante y realista.	1
Angus Scrimm también presenta una buena actuación en un papel algo breve pero memorable como el anatomista suavemente amenazador y violinista Doctor Quinn.	1
Conclusión: me encantó.	1
Hace mucho tiempo que no me entretiene una película.	1
Me cuesta encontrar algo malo que decir al respecto.	1
Recuerda mis palabras, esta es una de esas películas de culto como Evil Dead 2 o Phantasm que la gente aún descubrirá y se enamorará de 20, 30, 40 años más adelante.	1
Es bastante sorprendente que esta maravillosa película se haya hecho en 1949, ya que Hollywood generalmente tenía sus cabezas colectivas en la arena sobre cuestiones de blanco y negro en ese momento.	1
La película merece grandes elogios por tomar esta posición, por tener una actuación excepcional de su elenco en su mayoría menos conocido y por el guión súper inteligente que no insulta a la audiencia o toma la salida fácil cuando se trata del racismo blanco.	1
Además, con un presupuesto bastante modesto y un tiempo de ejecución rápido, ¡hace un trabajo increíble!	1

Esta película es posiblemente una de las obras de terror más creativas de la historia.	1

&quot;Con excelentes efectos de sonido e impresionantes efectos especiales, no puedo recomendar esta película lo suficiente.	1
Llámame loco, pero creo que esta es una de las mejores películas de la historia.	1

Ahora imagine que cada una de esas decisiones se hizo mal.	0
El diálogo es atroz.	0
La actuación es más que abismal.	0
Todo apesta.	0
El problema es que la escritura y la dirección hacen imposible establecer aquellas cosas que hacen que una película se pueda ver, como el personaje, la historia, el tema, etc.	0
Peor aún, hay una subtrama increíblemente débil que sigue a una pequeña banda de mansonitas de los últimos días mientras persiguen a un periodista que está trabajando en una historia en el aniversario de los asesinatos.	0
Es tonto y sin sentido, y una completa pérdida de tiempo.	0
En resumen, no te molestes con esta película.	0
No lo estropearé, pero el final es bastante sorprendente.	1
La mejor escena de la película está al final, pero no la estropearé.	1
Si alguna vez hubo una indicación de la habilidad de un escritor y un director para fusionar dos temperamentos altamente volátiles en una unión perfecta de creatividad, ¡entonces esto es todo!	1
El resultado es un logro poderoso, hecho más oportuno ahora quizás debido a la fascinante fascinación de nuestra cultura con la celebridad, y sus interpretaciones distorsionadas de la fama.	1
Una película que no se olvida fácilmente.	1
Pero Kevin Spacey es un excelente tsunami verbal como Buddy Ackerman, y totalmente creíble porque es un gran actor.	1
El guión de la sutil comedia no tiene comparación con ninguna película de los últimos años.	1
Los personajes son interesantes, incluso si son un poco predecibles.	1
Muy recomendable para todas las edades, aunque el conjunto más joven probablemente no apreciará algunas de las referencias más sutiles, ¡sin duda apreciarán una escena de galera en particular!	1
¡Gran pelicula!	1

Estaba aburrida durante toda la maldita cosa.	0
La actuación apesta, la música apesta, el guión apesta, el ritmo apesta, el FX especial apesta, la dirección apesta ... básicamente, esta película apesta.	0
Esta película intenta ser una película de suspenso / horror seria y sofisticada y falla miserablemente.	0
Esta es probablemente una de las películas menos efectivas y completamente poco originales que he visto en toda mi vida.	0
Una pieza de basura cinemática capturada en celuloide.	0

El único hilo consistente que mantuvo unida a la serie fueron las increíbles actuaciones de Leni Parker y Anita LaSelva como las dos Taelons en un tranquilo conflicto idealógico.	0
Ahora esta es una película que realmente no me gusta.	0
Es una de las películas de terror más aburridas de los años 90, principalmente porque comienza lentamente y se centra en una atmósfera aburrida.	0
Las marionetas se ven realmente cursi, no en el buen sentido como en las películas de Puppet Master 80.	0
La historia es patética, no interesante y NUNCA explica realmente los orígenes siniestros de los títeres.	0
No hay escenas de muerte como en películas anteriores y las f / x son terribles.	0
Me sentí dormido la primera vez que lo vi, por lo que puedo recomendarlo para los insomnes.	0
El hecho es que esta película es una historia maravillosa y conmovedora sobre dos personas persiguiendo sus sueños.	1
La mejor parte de &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; es su imprevisibilidad.	1
El director Neil LaBute usa la violencia brutal para separar los sueños de la realidad, y junto con el drama conmovedor y la comedia hilarante, nunca se sabe lo que sucederá después.	1
De lo contrario, ni siquiera pierdas tu tiempo en esto.	0
Este simplemente no puede crear ningún suspenso real.	0
En cuanto al asesino, no esperes nada original o incluso remotamente aterrador.	0
Sin embargo, hay una actuación bastante buena (al menos, para este tipo de película).	1
Lo siento mucho, pero realmente no puedo recomendarlo a nadie.	0
Una de las películas más aburridas e inútiles que he visto.	0
La línea de trama secundaria es incomprensible y su relación con la línea de trama primaria es desconcertante.	0
Lo odié.	0
Esta es una de las peores películas de Sandra Bullock desde Speed 2, pero no está tan mal.	0
No entiendo cómo esta basura llegó a los estantes de la tienda de películas, ¡ni siquiera es una película real!	0
Dudo mucho que a alguien le guste esta basura.	0
Esto no es hacer películas.	0

Excelente cortometraje.	1
Con suerte, el director James Cox puede convertir el cortometraje en un largometraje con el mismo elenco, o conquistarnos con una película completamente nueva.	1
Estoy de acuerdo con Jessica, esta película es bastante mala.	0
Los personajes son unidimensionales, incluso los buenos y especialmente los malos.	0
La historia es totalmente predecible.	0
No mucho diálogo, ni mucha música, toda la película fue filmada de manera tan elaborada y estética como una escultura.	1
He visto telenovelas más inteligentes que esta película.	0
Malos personajes, mala historia y mala actuación.	0
Realmente terrible.	0
No es fácil de ver.	0
Divertido, inteligente, moderno, ¡como la película anterior de Pray, Hype!	1
Hacía mucho tiempo que no veía a un actor tan carismático en la pantalla.	1
Paolo Sorrentino ha escrito una historia maravillosa sobre la soledad y Tony ha construido uno de los personajes más inolvidables vistos en películas en los últimos años.	1
La película no es completamente perfecta, pero &#39;Titta Di Girolamo&#39; se quedará con usted durante mucho tiempo después de la visión de la película.	1
Califico esta película 9/10.	1
No sé si este fue el debut como director de Emilio Estévez, pero el ritmo, la interacción y el desarrollo de los personajes, así como un trabajo inteligente de cámara que rodea al personaje que interpreta Estevez, sugieren un ojo natural.	1
La interacción entre Martin y Emilio contiene la misma química maravillosa que vimos en Wall Street con Martin y Charlie.	1
Kathy Bates es maravillosa en sus personajes, sutil desesperación y escapismo; una variación de su personaje en &quot;At Play In The Fields Of The Lord&quot;.	1
Para los lectores que ya han visto una de las películas de Miyazaki: todavía está en plena forma e hizo otra experiencia valiosa.	1
Nunca condesciende, todos los personajes tienen buenos corazones genuinos y problemas creíbles.	1
Los dos personajes principales pueden ser dos de los niños más creíbles que vi en la pantalla.	1
Son tan fáciles de amar, pero aún más fáciles de identificar.	1
Esta película es genial, especialmente si te gustan las artes visuales.	1
El paisaje que las dos hijas pintan y fotografían es hermoso.	1
La historia también es divertida y conmovedora a veces.	1
A las personas que les gustan las películas europeas y las &quot;películas de arte&quot; les gustará esta película.	1
Esta es realmente una película de arte, en realidad tiene mucho arte.	1
Ve a alquilarlo.	1
Sin embargo, después de ver finalmente esta película, me di cuenta de que no solo había tenido una mente cerrada con respecto al brillo que representa, sino que también me encontraba viéndolo una y otra vez.	1
Es la única película que nunca deja de interesarme, simplemente porque me mantiene alerta, mientras trato de descifrar sus significados.	1
Brillo de hecho.	1
Pero si le gustaron las películas como The Matrix (y mejor aún, sus secuelas), creo que apreciará la experiencia alucinante y alucinante que esta película le brindará.	1
Piensa en la película como un sueño.	1
Simplemente hermoso.	1
Tanto Rickman como Stowe desempeñan sus papeles hasta el fondo en esta historia de un escritor de libros para niños que, ¿tal vez? Ha escrito un tratado subversivo.	1
Es una representación gloriosamente divertida, trepidante y bastante precisa de la noche de un raver.	1
Presenta una representación idílica pero seria de los altibajos de las vidas de los personajes.	1
Haga lo que haga, evite &quot;Groove&quot;, ya que es la antítesis de todo lo bueno del tráfico humano.	0
Es una lástima que todos los demás involucrados no compartieran el nivel de dedicación de Crowe a la calidad, ya que si lo hicieran, tendríamos una película mucho mejor en nuestras manos que este desastre por debajo del par.	0
La película parecía un poco lenta al principio.	0
Pero aceleró y fue directo al grano.	1
Mostró exactamente cómo el gobierno y el científico abogaron por la humanidad y las razones del &quot;dispositivo&quot;.	1
Me gustó mucho.	1
Lo he recomendado a mis amigos.	1
Estaba particularmente satisfecho con la capacidad de actuación de Dwight Schultz.	1
Ambos actores realmente entienden y se convierten en su personaje particular, ofreciendo una actuación convincente y sincera.	1
Su química en pantalla, crítica para toda la película, es genuina.	1
El diálogo de la película es natural, real para la vida.	1
El escritor Gorman Bechard, sin duda, hizo su tarea porque todas las referencias son apropiadas para la industria y la edad de los personajes.	1
La increíble banda sonora realmente captura la esencia de la película.	1
Cada pista tiene sentimientos, contribuyendo realmente a las escenas y personajes.	1
Definitivamente vale la pena verlo ... es el tipo de película que invita a la reflexión que te obliga a cuestionar tu propio umbral de soledad.	1
La última y octava película de Hayao Miyazaki para Studio Ghibili, &quot;Gake No Ue No Ponyo&quot; (Ponyo en el acantilado junto al mar) es una mirada maravillosamente divertida e imaginativa de la infancia.	1
En un momento en que parece que la animación cinematográfica ha estado dominada por las obras maestras de CGI de Disney / Pixar, es refrescante y reconfortante saber que Miyazaki todavía se basa en la animación tradicional dibujada a mano para contar sus historias encantadoras y encantadoras.	1
No se puede decir lo suficiente de la notable animación de esta película.	1
El estilo artístico tiene la apariencia de dibujos a lápiz / lápiz y es maravillosamente colorido y fantasioso.	1
Si actúas en una película así, ¡deberías estar contento de que te alejarás lo más posible de la tierra!	0
Este quiere navegar en la pequeña ola de películas espaciales en 1998 (Deep Impact y Armageddon), y este falla en todas partes.	0
Si al final no te has atragantado con tu propio vómito (por todo el drama barato y el diálogo inútil), debes haberte aburrido hasta la muerte con esta pérdida de tiempo.	0
Aún así, compensa todo esto con un súper final que representa una gran embarcación marina que es sacada por la poderosa helada.	1
Solo considere la excelente historia, la actuación sólida y el aspecto de la película como bonos adicionales.	1
En cambio, tuvimos un aburrido festival sobre un niño quejumbroso y malcriado que cuida niños.	0
Luego lo volví a ver hace dos domingos (20 de marzo de 2005) y comencé a disfrutarlo realmente y esta vez grabé todo.	1
Es una película de televisión muy bien actuada y hecha.	1
¡Judith Light es una de mis actrices favoritas y creo que hace un excelente trabajo en esta película!	1
Lo sigo mirando una y otra vez.	1
Es una película triste, pero muy buena.	1
Si no has visto esta película, ¡definitivamente te la recomiendo!	1
Ella es tan encantadora como siempre, esta chica!	1
Aún así, es bastante interesante y entretenido seguirlo.	1
;) Recomiende con confianza!	1
Esta película está bien equilibrada con comedia y drama y disfruté muchísimo.	1
Fue un disturbio ver a Hugo Weaving interpretar a un vendedor de bienes raíces gay obsesionado con el sexo que usa las casas de sus clientes para sus citas con el en llamas Darren (Tom Hollander).	1
:) De todos modos, la trama fluyó sin problemas y las escenas de unión masculina fueron un puntazo.	1
La secuencia de apertura de esta gema es un clásico, y los juegos de gato y ratón que siguen son una delicia para ver.	1
Los fanáticos del género estarán en el cielo.	1
Lange se había convertido en una gran actriz.	1
Parecía una historia maravillosa.	1
Nunca salí de una película más rápido.	0
¡Me aburrí de ver a Jessice Lange quitarse la ropa!	0
Desafortunadamente, cualquier virtud en el trabajo de producción de esta película se perdió en un guión lamentable.	0
En una palabra, es vergonzoso.	0
Excepcionalmente malo!	0
En general, es un insulto a la inteligencia y una gran pérdida de dinero.	0
Guau ... Me encantó este lugar.	1
La corteza no es buena.	0
No es sabroso y la textura era desagradable.	0
Pasé por el feriado bancario de finales de mayo por recomendación de Rick Steve y me encantó.	1
La selección en el menú era genial, al igual que los precios.	1
Ahora me estoy enojando y quiero mi maldita pho.	0
Honeslty no sabía TAN fresco.)	0
Las papas eran como el caucho y se notaba que se habían preparado con anticipación para mantenerlas debajo de un calentador.	0
Las patatas fritas también eran geniales.	1
Un gran toque.	1
El servicio fue muy rápido.	1
No volvería	0
Al cajero no le importó lo que tenía que decir, pero terminó siendo demasiado caro.	0
Probé el ravoli de Cape Cod, pollo, con arándanos ... mmmm!	1
Estaba disgustado porque estaba bastante seguro de que era cabello humano.	0
Me sorprendió porque no hay señales que indiquen solo efectivo.	0
Muy recomendable.	1
La camarera era un poco lenta en el servicio.	0
Este lugar no vale la pena, y mucho menos Las Vegas.	0
no me gustó en absoluto.	0
El Burrittos Blah!	0
La comida, increíble.	1
El servicio también es lindo.	1
Me podría importar menos ... El interior es simplemente hermoso.	1
Entonces se presentaron.	1
Así es ... el pastel de terciopelo rojo ... ohhh esto es tan bueno.	1
- Nunca trajeron una ensalada que pedimos.	0
Este hoyo en la pared tiene excelentes tacos callejeros mexicanos y un personal amable.	1
Tomó una hora para conseguir nuestra comida, solo 4 mesas en el restaurante, mi comida era Luke tibia, Nuestro servidor estaba corriendo como si estuviera totalmente abrumado.	0
Lo peor fue el sashimi de salmón.	0
También hay combos como una hamburguesa, papas fritas y cerveza para 23, que es un trato decente.	1
¡Esto fue como el golpe final!	0
Encontré este lugar por accidente y no podría estar más feliz.	1
Parece un buen lugar rápido para tomar un bocado de comida familiar de pub, pero hazte un favor y busca en otro lado.	0
En general, me gusta mucho este lugar.	1
La única cualidad redentora del restaurante es que era muy económico.	1
Amplias raciones y buenos precios.	1
Mal servicio, el camarero me hizo sentir como si fuera estúpido cada vez que vino a la mesa.	0
¡Mi primera visita a Hiro fue una delicia!	1
El servicio apesta.	0
Los camarones tiernos y húmedos.	1
No hay un acuerdo lo suficientemente bueno que me arrastre a ese establecimiento nuevamente.	0
Es difícil juzgar si estos lados eran buenos porque nos asqueó la espuma de poliestireno derretida y no queríamos comerla por miedo a enfermarnos.	0
En una nota positiva, nuestro servidor fue muy atento y proporcionó un gran servicio.	1
Discos congelados de asco, con algunas de las peores personas detrás del registro.	0
Lo único que me gustó fue la sección de costillas y postres.	1
Es una pena que la comida sea tan genérica.	0
La hamburguesa es buena carne, cocinada a la perfección.	1
¡Si quieres un sándwich, ve a cualquier estación de bomberos!	1
Mi ensalada griega con el aderezo griego era muy sabrosa, y la pita y hummus era muy refrescante.	1
Pedimos el pato raro y era rosado y tierno por dentro con un bonito char en el exterior.	1
Vino corriendo detrás de nosotros cuando se dio cuenta de que mi esposo había dejado sus gafas de sol sobre la mesa.	1
Su chow mein es tan bueno!	1
Tienen actitudes horribles hacia los clientes y hablan con cada uno cuando los clientes no disfrutan de su comida.	0
¡La porción era enorme!	1
Me encantó ... servidores amables, buena comida, menú maravilloso e imaginativo.	1
El Heart Attack Grill en el centro de Las Vegas es una excusa absolutamente plana para un restaurante.	0
No hay mucho marisco y como 5 cadenas de pasta en el fondo.	0
La ensalada tenía la cantidad justa de salsa para no sobrecargar la vieira, que estaba perfectamente preparada.	1
El plátano desgarrado no solo estaba desgarrado, sino que estaba petrificado e insípido.	0
Al menos piensa en rellenar mi agua antes de que me esfuerce por saludarte durante 10 minutos.	0
¡Este lugar recibe estrellas por sus APERITIVOS!	1
Los cócteles son todos hechos a mano y deliciosos.	1
Definitivamente regresaríamos aquí de nuevo.	1
Estamos muy contentos de haber encontrado este lugar.	1
Buena comida y servicio, grandes porciones y dan un descuento militar.	1
Siempre un buen momento en Dos Gringos!	1
Actualización ... regresó por segunda vez y todavía fue igual de increíble	1
Conseguimos la comida y aparentemente nunca han oído hablar de la sal y la masa del pescado era masticable.	0
Una excelente manera de terminar un gran.	1
El acuerdo incluía 5 degustaciones y 2 bebidas, y Jeff fue más allá de lo que esperábamos.	1
- Muy, muy buen arroz, todo el tiempo.	1
El servicio fue meh.	0
Le tomó más de 30 minutos obtener su batido, que no era más que leche con chocolate.	0
Supongo que debería haber sabido que este lugar apestaría, porque está dentro del Excalibur, pero no usé mi sentido común.	0
El plato de vieira también es bastante atroz por su valor.	0
2 veces - ¡Muy mal servicio al cliente!	0
Las batatas fritas eran muy buenas y sazonadas bien.	1
Hoy es la segunda vez que he estado en su almuerzo buffet y fue bastante bueno.	1
Hay tanta buena comida en Las Vegas que me siento engañado por desperdiciar una oportunidad de comer yendo a Rice and Company.	0
Venir aquí es como experimentar una relación decepcionante donde ambas partes no pueden esperar a que la otra persona pida que se separe.	0
Entró y el lugar olía a una vieja trampa de grasa y solo 2 otros allí comiendo.	0
El pavo y el rosbif eran sosos.	0
Este lugar lo tiene!	1
Los pasteles de pan que todos están entusiasmados con el sabor como un desastre azucarado adaptado al paladar de un niño de seis años.	0
Me encanta el Pho y los rollitos de primavera, qué rico que tienes que probar.	1
La pobre relación entre la masa y la carne hizo que las ofertas de pollo fueran muy insatisfactorias.	0
Todo lo que tengo que decir es que la comida era increíble!	1
¡Las tortillas son para morirse!	1
¡Todo era fresco y delicioso!	1
En resumen, esta fue una experiencia gastronómica muy decepcionante.	0
Es como una fiesta realmente sexy en tu boca, donde coqueteas escandalosamente con la persona más sexy de la fiesta.	1
Nunca antes había estado en Hard Rock Casino, ¡NUNCA PODRÁ ADELANTARLO DE NUEVO!	0
El mejor desayuno buffet!	1
¡Di adiós a tu consejo, señora!	0
Nunca iremos de nuevo.	0
Volveremos de nuevo!	1
¡La comida llegó rápidamente!	1
No era bueno.	0
En el lado positivo, su cafetería sirve muy buena comida.	1
Nuestro camarero fue fantástico y cuando descubrió que a la esposa le encanta el ajo asado y la médula ósea, ¡agregó más a nuestra comida y otra médula para llevar!	1
Lo único bueno fue nuestro camarero, fue muy servicial y mantuvo la bloddy Mary&#39;s venir.	1
El mejor buffet de la ciudad, por el precio no se puede superar.	1
ME ENCANTARON sus mejillones cocinados en esta reducción de vino, el pato estaba tierno y sus platos de papa estaban deliciosos.	1
Este es uno de los mejores buffets en los que he estado.	1
¡Así que fuimos a Tigerlilly y pasamos una tarde fantástica!	1
La comida era deliciosa, nuestro camarero fue atento y agradable y nos dieron una buena oferta!	1
El ambiente es maravilloso y hay música sonando.	1
Volveremos el próximo viaje.	1
Tan bueno !!	1
Los verdaderos amantes del sushi, seamos honestos: Yama no es tan bueno.	0

¡Fue bastante asqueroso!	0
He tenido mejor ambiente.	0
Un poco difícil de estropear un bistec, pero lo hicieron.	0
Aunque me gustó mucho el aspecto y el sonido de este lugar, la experiencia real fue un poco decepcionante.	0
Simplemente no sé cómo este lugar logró servir la comida más blanda que he comido cuando preparan cocina india.	0
El peor servicio para arrancar, pero esa es la menor de sus preocupaciones.	0
El servicio fue bueno y la camarera fue amable.	1
Todos los chicos tenían bistecs, y nuestro hijo amante de los bistecs que ha comido bistec en los mejores y peores lugares dijo que era el mejor bistec que había comido.	1
Pensamos que tendrías que aventurarte más lejos para conseguir un buen sushi, pero este lugar realmente dio en el clavo esa noche.	1
El personal anfitrión fue, a falta de una palabra mejor, ¡PERRAS!	0
Bland ... No me gusta este lugar por varias razones y no quiero perder el tiempo en malas críticas ... Lo dejaré así ...	0
Comida fenomenal, servicio y ambiente.	1
No volvería	0
Definitivamente vale la pena aventurarse fuera de la avenida principal para el vientre de cerdo, volveremos la próxima vez que esté en Las Vegas.	1
Este lugar es demasiado caro para la comida mediocre.	0
Penne vodka excelente!	1
Tienen una buena selección de comida que incluye un sándwich de pastel de carne masivo, una crujiente envoltura de pollo, un delicioso atún derretido y algunas sabrosas hamburguesas.	1
La administración es grosera.	0
Deliciosos panecillos de Nueva York, buenas selecciones de queso crema, Lox real con alcaparras incluso.	1
Gran metro, de hecho, es tan bueno cuando vienes aquí, cada otro metro no satisfará tus expectativas.	1
Tuve un desayuno realmente sólido aquí.	1
Este es uno de los mejores bares con comida en Las Vegas.	1
Fue extremadamente grosero y realmente, hay muchos otros restaurantes en los que me encantaría cenar durante un fin de semana en Las Vegas.	0
Mi bebida nunca estaba vacía e hizo algunas sugerencias de menú realmente geniales.	1
¡No lo hagas!	0
El camarero no era servicial o amable y rara vez se registró en nosotros.	0
Mi esposo y yo almorzamos aquí y quedamos muy decepcionados con la comida y el servicio.	0
Y el curry rojo tenía tantos brotes de bambú y no era muy sabroso para mí.	0
Bonita manta de moz sobre la parte superior, pero siento que esto se hizo para cubrir la comida deficiente.	1
Los baños están limpios y el lugar en sí está bien decorado.	1
El menú siempre cambia, la calidad de la comida está bajando y el servicio es extremadamente lento.	0
El servicio fue un poco lento, teniendo en cuenta que fueron atendidos por servidores de 3 personas, por lo que la comida llegaba a un ritmo lento.	0
Le doy 2 pulgares hacia abajo	0
Vimos a nuestro camarero prestar mucha más atención a otras mesas e ignorarnos.	0

Este lugar es bueno.	1
Desafortunadamente, debemos haber llegado a la panadería el día que quedaba porque todo lo que pedimos era STALE.	0
Regresé hoy desde que se mudaron y todavía no estoy impresionado.	0

Este lugar es uno de los mejores lugares para comer en el área metropolitana de Phoenix.	1
Así que no vayas si buscas buena comida ...	0
Nunca me han tratado tan mal.	0
El tocino es hella salado.	1
También pedimos la ensalada de espinacas y aguacate; los ingredientes estaban tristes y el aderezo literalmente tenía cero sabor.	0
Así es como solía ser la buena comida de Las Vegas, hasta los menús entregados a las damas que no tienen precios listados.	1
Las camareras son muy amables.	1
¡Lordy, el Khao Soi es un plato que no se puede perder para los amantes del curry!	1
Todo en el menú es excelente y también nos encantó que hicieron alojamientos increíbles para nuestra hija vegetariana.	1
Tal vez los atrapé en una noche libre a juzgar por las otras críticas, pero no estoy inspirado para volver.	0
El servicio aquí deja mucho que desear.	0
El ambiente es moderno y moderno, manteniendo un toque de comodidad.	1
No es una guarida semanal, pero definitivamente es un lugar al que volver de vez en cuando.	1
Literalmente nos quedamos allí sentados durante 20 minutos sin que nadie pidiera tomar nuestro pedido.	0
La hamburguesa no tenía absolutamente ningún sabor: la carne en sí era totalmente blanda, la hamburguesa estaba demasiado cocida y no había sabor a carbón.	0
También decidí no devolverlo porque parecía que nuestra camarera estaba a punto de sufrir un ataque cardíaco.	0
Me vestí para ser tratado tan groseramente!	0
Probablemente fue suciedad.	0

Interesante decoración.	1
Lo que realmente me gusta es la estación de crepes.	1

¡puedes verlos preparar la deliciosa comida!)	1
Ambos rollos de huevo eran fantásticos.	1
Cuando llegó mi pedido, faltaba uno de los giroscopios.	0

La peor experiencia de la historia.	0
Debe haber sido una noche libre en este lugar.	0
Los lados son deliciosos: champiñones mixtos, puré de oro de yukón, maíz blanco, beateous.	1
Si ese error nunca apareciera, habría dado un 4 seguro, pero en el otro lado de la pared donde estaba escalando el error estaba la cocina.	0

El servicio fue un poco escaso.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL necesitaban sal y pimienta ... y, por supuesto, no hay ninguno en las mesas.	0
Esperemos que esto sea un buen augurio para ellos que quiebren y que alguien que pueda cocinar pueda entrar.	0

Gran lugar para tomar un par de copas y ver todos los eventos deportivos, ya que las paredes están cubiertas de televisores.	1
Si fuera posible darles cero estrellas, lo tendrían.	0

Yo diría que esa sería la decisión más difícil ... Honestamente, todos los platos de M saben como se supone que deben saber (increíble).	1
Si ella no hubiera puesto los ojos en blanco, podríamos habernos quedado ... No estoy seguro de si volveremos e intentaremos de nuevo.	0
Todos están muy atentos y brindan un excelente servicio al cliente.	1
Horrible: no pierdas tu tiempo y dinero.	0

En serio sabrosas delicias, amigos.	1
Mucho mejor que el otro lugar de sushi AYCE al que fui en Las Vegas.	1
La iluminación es lo suficientemente oscura como para crear el ambiente.	1
Según el servicio inferior que recibí y ningún esfuerzo por mostrar su gratitud por mi negocio, no volveré.	0
Los propietarios son personas realmente geniales.	1
No hay nada privilegiado sobre trabajar / comer allí.	0
El aderezo griego era muy cremoso y sabroso.	1
En general, no creo que vuelva a llevar a mis padres a este lugar porque hicieron la mayoría de las quejas similares que también sentí en silencio.	0
Ahora la pizza en sí era buena, la salsa de maní era muy sabrosa.	1
Teníamos 7 en nuestra mesa y el servicio fue bastante rápido.	1
Fantástico servicio aquí.	1
